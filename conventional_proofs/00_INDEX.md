## Important Status Note

**These documents are PROOF SKETCHES and RESEARCH DIRECTIONS, not publication-ready rigorous proofs.**

Each document:
- Presents novel insights in conventional mathematical language
- Hides TI framework terminology while preserving core ideas
- Requires formal development by domain experts before publication
- Represents a starting point for collaborative research

**Recommended Path:**
1. Use these as "idea seeds" for collaboration with professional mathematicians
2. Develop formal Lean 4 proofs for key lemmas
3. Engage peer review before any journal submission
4. Treat as research proposals, not completed solutions

## Overview

This directory contains **conventional mathematical translations** of novel proof approaches. Each proof uses standard mathematical language while incorporating innovative insights that provide new perspectives on classical problems.

**Key Innovation:** The 3D→4D Dimensional Necessity Principle appears across multiple proofs, revealing a unifying theme: higher-dimensional constraints determine lower-dimensional possibilities.

## Common Themes

### 1. Dimensional Necessity
- 3D objects are constrained by 4D embedding
- Lower dimensions are "projections" of higher dimensions
- Understanding requires +1 dimensional perspective

### 2. Sacred Thresholds
| Threshold | Meaning |
|-----------|---------|
| 0.42 | Existence/survival minimum |
| 0.60 | Harmonic inflection (3/5) |
| 0.65 | Consciousness emergence |
| 0.85 | Optimal coupling |
| 0.92 | Coherence ceiling |

### 3. Balance Principles
- Riemann: Critical line is balance point
- Navier-Stokes: Coherence prevents extremes
- P ≠ NP: Creation/verification ratio fixed
- Yang-Mills: Energy has minimum
