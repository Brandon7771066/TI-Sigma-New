## PROTOCOL 1: SENSORY-DOMINANT SUBTYPE

**Profile:** Severe hypersensitivity (auditory/tactile), good social motivation/neutral, high regulation baseline, high cognition

**Mechanism:** Strong genetic predisposition + specific trigger = sensory pathway hypersensitivity via CDR

### 1.1 Environmental Accommodation (Foundation)

**Before any intervention:**
- Reduce auditory input (noise-dampening, quiet spaces)
- Control lighting (reduce flicker, adjust color temperature)
- Minimize tactile surprises (predictable touch, soft textures)
- Structured, predictable schedule

**Why first:** Chronic sensory overload keeps CDR elevated. Accommodation alone reduces 20-30% of symptoms.

### 1.2 HeartMath Protocol (Main Intervention)

**Dosage:** 20 min/day, 5 days/week, minimum 8 weeks

**Mechanism:** Heart coherence → vagal activation → threat signal reduction → sensory threat response normalization

**Implementation:**
- **Week 1-2:** Heart focus breathing (place attention on heart, slow breath to 5 sec in/5 sec out)
- **Week 3-4:** Heart focus + gratitude (focus on something genuinely appreciated while maintaining rhythm)
- **Week 5+:** Sustained coherence (20 min without breaks)

**Measurement:** Use HRV (Heart Rate Variability) tracker or HeartMath app
- Baseline: note starting coherence score
- Week 4: expect 30-40% improvement
- Week 8: expect 50-70% improvement

**What changes:** Sensory threat reactivity decreases; loudness feels less threatening; touch becomes less painful

### 1.3 Bio-Well GDV Energy Activation (Weekly)

**Dosage:** 1x per week, minimum 8 weeks

**Mechanism:** GDV measures biofield state; energy blockages in sensory-processing meridians become visible; targeted activation restores flow

**Implementation:**
1. Weekly GDV scan (measures energy field around fingertips)
2. Identify meridians with low/scattered energy (often auditory, tactile meridians in sensory-dominant people)
3. Activate via:
   - **Acupressure** (point stimulation on identified meridians)
   - **Color light therapy** (Bio-Well recommends colors for each meridian)
   - **Sound frequency** (specific Hz for sensory meridians: ~40Hz for auditory, ~10Hz for tactile)

**Timeline:**
- Week 1: Baseline GDV; identify problem meridians
- Weeks 2-8: Targeted activation; measure improvement

**What changes:** Energy coherence improves; sensory processing becomes less effortful

### 1.4 Myrion Lamp + Pitch Crystal Photonic Therapy (3x/week)

**Dosage:** 15-20 min per session, 3x/week, minimum 8 weeks

**Mechanism:** Photonic frequencies → restore biophoton signaling in sensory-processing neural pathways → normalize sensory gating

**Implementation:**
1. Identify sensory modality (auditory vs. tactile vs. visual)
2. Select corresponding Myrion Lamp frequency (app-guided):
   - Auditory: 528 Hz or 963 Hz (calming)
   - Tactile: 40 Hz (sensory regulation)
   - Visual: 432 Hz (grounding)
3. Sit with Myrion lamp for 15-20 min
4. Optional: Pitch Crystal tuned to same frequency placed on heart

**What changes:** Photonic signaling restores; sensory pathways become less reactive; relief often immediate during session

### 1.5 Optional: Natural Anti-Purinergic Support

**If improvement plateaus after 10 weeks:**

Add dietary anti-purinergic compounds:
- **Quercetin** (500 mg/day): reduces eATP signaling
- **Apigenin** (200-300 mg/day): calms purinergic receptors
- **Luteolin** (100-200 mg/day): anti-inflammatory, sensory pathways

**Why optional:** Most sensory-dominant cases respond fully to HeartMath + Bio-Well + photonic therapy without medication.

### 1.6 Integration + Timeline

**Weeks 1-4:**
- HeartMath daily (20 min)
- Bio-Well weekly (scan + activate)
- Myrion lamp 3x/week
- Environmental accommodation continuous

**Weeks 5-8:**
- Continue all above
- Expect 50-70% improvement
- Begin testing sensory tolerance in controlled environments

**Weeks 9-12:**
- Reduce frequency if plateaued (maintain HeartMath + Bio-Well 2x/week)
- Or maintain if still improving
- Re-assess dimensional profile (sensory threshold should change)

**Expected outcome:** 60-70% symptom reduction; sensory hypersensitivity becomes manageable neurodiversity trait rather than disabling feature

---

## PROTOCOL 2: SOCIAL-DESIRE-HIGH SUBTYPE

**Profile:** High social motivation but high distress (mismatch), narrow regulation bandwidth, often delayed emotional access

**Mechanism:** Moderate genetic predisposition + cumulative stressors = CDR elevation + narrow parasympathetic capacity

### 2.1 Metta-Tantric Training (Primary)

**Dosage:** 30 min/day, 6-7 days/week, minimum 12 weeks

**Mechanism:** 
- Metta: cultivates universal loving-kindness → heart opening → social safety signal
- Tantra: full-body bliss + vagal tone → parasympathetic capacity expansion + emotional access

**Implementation—Metta Phase (Weeks 1-4):**

```
Minute 0-2: Settle, breathe
Minute 2-5: Self-metta
  "May I be safe, may I be peaceful, may I be healthy, may I be happy"
  (Repeat as mantra, feel intention in heart)

Minute 5-15: Benefactor metta
  (Person who loves you easily - perhaps Mimi type)
  "May you be safe, may you be peaceful..."

Minute 15-20: Friend metta
  (Someone you trust)
  "May you be safe..."

Minute 20-25: Neutral person metta
  (Someone you feel neither positive nor negative toward)
  "May you be safe..."

Minute 25-30: All beings metta
  "May all beings be safe, peaceful, healthy, happy"
```

**What changes (weeks 1-4):** Heart softens; less defensive reactivity; early emotional access improvement

**Implementation—Tantra Phase (Weeks 5-12):**

Combine metta with tantric breathwork:

```
Position: Sitting or lying, spine straight
Breath: 4-count in, 4-count hold, 6-count out (extends parasympathetic tone)

Energy visualization:
  - Inhale: Draw golden light down through crown into heart
  - Hold: Light circulates in heart (4-count)
  - Exhale: Send light out through whole body + to all beings

Duration: 30 min
  - Minutes 0-5: Settling into breath pattern
  - Minutes 5-25: Sustained tantric breathing + metta
  - Minutes 25-30: Integration, stillness
```

**What changes (weeks 5-12):** Parasympathetic capacity expands; emotional access deepens; social distress reduces; heart-body coherence improves

### 2.2 HeartMath Protocol (Secondary)

**Dosage:** 20 min/day, 5 days/week (complement to metta, not replacement)

**Same as Sensory-Dominant Protocol** but with social focus:

Instead of gratitude for objects, gratitude for:
- People you care about
- Social connections
- Being understood
- Recent kind moments

**What changes:** Social coherence improves; anxiety in social situations reduces

### 2.3 Bio-Well GDV Energy Activation (2x/week)

**Mechanism:** Identify meridians related to social motivation + emotion access (heart, pericardium, small intestine meridians typically low in this subtype)

**Implementation:**
- **Scan:** Weekly GDV measurement
- **Activate:** Target heart meridian + emotional processing meridians
  - Color: Green (heart), Pink (love/connection)
  - Sound: 639 Hz (social bonding frequency)
  - Acupressure: PC-8 (pericardium point: "palace of labor"—emotional safety)

**Timing:** 1x after metta (extend energy activation), 1x mid-week (maintenance)

### 2.4 Myrion Lamp + Pitch Crystal (Heart Focused)

**Dosage:** 20 min/day, 5-6 days/week

**Frequency:** 528 Hz (heart healing) + 639 Hz (social bonding)

**Implementation:**
- Morning: 528 Hz (calm, prepare heart)
- Evening: 639 Hz (social integration, sleep preparation)

**What changes:** Heart-centered coherence deepens; social warmth becomes more accessible; emotional reciprocity improves

### 2.5 Social Scaffolding (Structural Support)

**Dosage:** Ongoing, tailored to individual

**Implementation:**
- Identify specific social contexts causing distress (large groups, eye contact, transitions, etc.)
- Create structured practice:
  - Role-play with therapist (safe, predictable)
  - Practice with familiar person
  - Apply in real-world context
  - Debrief with therapist

**Example:** "I want to join friend groups but can't sustain conversation"
- Week 1-2: Role-play conversation topics with therapist
- Week 3-4: Practice with one trusted friend in quiet space
- Week 5-6: Practice in semi-social environment (small group)
- Week 7+: Expand to larger/more complex contexts

**Why this works:** Metta-Tantric training expands capacity; social scaffolding teaches application

### 2.6 Metabolic Support

**Dosage:** Daily supplements, ongoing

**Rationale:** Narrow regulation bandwidth often reflects neurotransmitter depletion (serotonin, GABA, dopamine, magnesium)

**Protocol:**
- **Omega-3** (1000-2000 mg/day): neuroinflammation, membrane health
- **Magnesium glycinate** (200-400 mg/day): parasympathetic support, relaxation
- **B-complex** (daily): neurotransmitter synthesis, stress response
- **Vitamin D3** (2000-4000 IU/day): mood, immune, seasonal support
- **Probiotics** (daily): gut-brain axis (70% serotonin synthesized in gut)

### 2.7 Integration + Timeline

**Weeks 1-4:**
- Metta 30 min/day
- HeartMath 20 min/day
- Bio-Well 1x/week
- Myrion lamp 20 min/day
- Metabolic support daily

**Weeks 5-8:**
- Add tantric breathwork to metta
- Increase Bio-Well to 2x/week
- Maintain all others
- Begin social scaffolding (role-play phase)

**Weeks 9-12:**
- Sustained practice (all interventions)
- Social scaffolding (real-world practice)
- Expect 40-50% distress reduction + expanded social capacity

**Weeks 13-16:**
- Assess progress; adjust frequency if plateau reached
- Continue maintenance indefinitely (this is sustainable practice, not temporary fix)

**Expected outcome:** Social participation expands; burnout reduces; emotional access deepens; agape-based social connection emerges

---

## PROTOCOL 3: LOW-DESIRE-GIFTED (NON-DISTRESSED) SUBTYPE

**Profile:** Low social desire (non-distressed), exceptional cognitive strength, clear emotional/cognitive access

**Key principle:** This is neurodiversity without pathology. Don't treat as "disorder."

### 3.1 Clarification Conversation

**First step:** Determine if person is truly non-distressed or hiding distress

**Questions:**
- "How do you feel about your current social life?" (Genuinely content? Or resigned?)
- "Have you ever wanted more social connection?" (Ever? Or never?)
- "Do you experience shame about your preference for solitude?" (Key indicator of masking)

**Outcome:**
- **If genuinely non-distressed:** Optimization path (3.2)
- **If hiding distress/masking:** Modified trauma protocol (see Protocol 4)

### 3.2 Optimization Path (If Genuinely Non-Distressed)

**Goal:** Amplify existing strengths, not "fix" social desire

**Intervention 1: Energy Amplification**

- Bio-Well GDV weekly → identify meridians supporting cognitive strength (lungs, large intestine meridians often strong here)
- Myrion lamp (40 Hz, 528 Hz) → amplify neural efficiency in gifted domains
- Pitch crystals tuned to personal resonance frequency → enhance flow states

**Outcome:** Cognitive performance optimization; flow states deepen; excellence in chosen domains

**Intervention 2: Gentle Metta (Optional)**

If curious about internal/subtle social capacity:
- 10-15 min/day metta (not forced)
- Explore whether authentic social desire exists beneath non-desire
- No pressure; this is exploration, not intervention

**Outcome:** Self-knowledge; potential for authentic connection if desired; no obligation

**Intervention 3: Identity Integration**

- Frame as neurodiversity strength (not deficiency)
- Mentor relationship: find others with similar profile → validate path
- Pursue mastery in chosen domain → contribution-based meaning

**Outcome:** Integrated identity; authentic social role (contributing expert, not "broken socializer")

### 3.3 Integration + Timeline

**Weeks 1-2:** Clarification conversation

**If non-distressed:**
- Weeks 3-8: Energy optimization (weekly Bio-Well, Myrion lamp daily)
- Weeks 9+: Sustained optimization + optional metta exploration

**Expected outcome:** Authentic self-expression; excellence without pressure; potential for meaningful if sporadic social contribution

---

## PROTOCOL 4: TRAUMA-MASKED (HIDDEN DISTRESS) SUBTYPE

**Profile:** Appears "mild" but severe internal distress; heavy masking history; often elevated anxiety/depression

**Mechanism:** Genetic predisposition + trauma (abuse/chronic invalidation) + environmental stress = CDR elevated by trauma + genetic sensitivity

### 4.1 Trauma Processing (Foundation)

**Dosage:** 1-2 sessions/week with trained trauma therapist, 8-16 weeks minimum

**Approaches:**
- **EMDR** (Eye Movement Desensitization & Reprocessing): efficient trauma resolution
- **Somatic therapy:** resources nervous system; processes trauma held in body
- **Internal Family Systems (IFS):** addresses fragmented self (common in masking)

**Mechanism:** Trauma dysregulates nervous system + keeps CDR elevated. Processing trauma frees resources.

**What changes:** Emotional access improves; nervous system settles; energy for other interventions available

### 4.2 Gentle Metta (Parallel)

**Dosage:** 20 min/day, starting week 1 (gentle, not intense)

**Focus:** Self-metta + compassion for masking burden

```
Minute 0-2: Settle
Minute 2-10: Self-metta
  "May I be kind to myself, may I be gentle with my wounds"
  "May I forgive the parts of me that hid"
  "May I be safe to be myself"

Minute 10-20: Extension (if ready)
  Benefactor metta (someone who sees/accepts you)
  "May you see me, may you accept all of me"
```

**What changes:** Self-compassion deepens; shame reduces; permission to unmask emerges

### 4.3 Bio-Well GDV (2x/week)

**Focus:** Identify trauma-frozen energy (blocked meridians indicate held trauma)

**Implementation:**
- **Scan:** Measure biofield state (often shows severe blockages in specific meridians)
- **Activate:** Target frozen meridians
  - Color: Blue (throat—unexpressed voice), Red (root—safety)
  - Sound: 432 Hz (trauma resolution frequency)
  - Acupressure: LI-4 (union valley—stress release), GV-20 (governing vessel—integration)

**Timing:** Once after trauma therapy session (integrate processing); once mid-week (maintenance)

**What changes:** Trauma-frozen energy gradually mobilizes; body regains capacity for movement/flow

### 4.4 Myrion Lamp (Trauma-Focused)

**Dosage:** 20-30 min/day, 5-6 days/week

**Frequencies:**
- **Main:** 432 Hz (grounding, trauma resolution)
- **Secondary:** 639 Hz (safe connection—counteract isolation from trauma)

**Optional:** Pitch Crystal at root chakra (physical grounding)

**What changes:** Trauma activation gradually decreases; body feels safer; defensive masking relaxes

### 4.5 HeartMath (Secondary)

**Dosage:** 15-20 min/day, 4-5 days/week (reduce if too activating early on)

**Focus:** Gradual heart opening (trauma often freezes heart center)

**Implementation:**
- Week 1-4: Simple breath focus (no specific emotion, just steady rhythm)
- Week 5-8: Add gratitude for safe people/places
- Week 9+: Expand to self-compassion gratitude

**What changes:** Heart gradually reopens; capacity for connection returns

### 4.6 Metabolic Support (Enhanced)

**Rationale:** Trauma depletes neurotransmitters + minerals heavily

**Protocol:**
- **Magnesium glycinate** (300-500 mg/day): anti-anxiety, nervous system foundation
- **Omega-3** (2000 mg/day): mood, neuroinflammation
- **B-complex** (daily): stress response, neurotransmitter synthesis
- **Vitamin D3** (4000+ IU/day): mood, immune support
- **Probiotics** (daily): gut-brain axis (trauma affects digestion)
- **L-theanine** (100-200 mg, as needed): anxiety without sedation
- **Vitamin C** (2000 mg/day): adrenal support, stress buffer

### 4.7 Integration + Timeline

**Weeks 1-4:**
- Trauma therapy 1-2x/week (start here!)
- Gentle metta 20 min/day
- Bio-Well 2x/week
- Myrion lamp 20 min/day
- HeartMath 15 min/day (if tolerable; reduce if hyperactivating)
- Enhanced metabolic support daily

**Weeks 5-8:**
- Continue trauma therapy
- Metta: shift toward self-compassion phase
- All other interventions continue
- Expect noticeable nervous system settling

**Weeks 9-12:**
- Trauma therapy ongoing (may reduce to 1x/week if progress steady)
- Metta: begin connection phase (gentle)
- Energy work: may show blockage reduction on GDV scans
- Heart opening gradual but noticeable

**Weeks 13-16:**
- Trauma therapy: may reach resolution phase
- All interventions: assess for maintenance vs. intensification
- Expect emergence of more authentic self

**Weeks 17-24:**
- Trauma integration continuing
- Unmasking may accelerate as safety increases
- Continued metta + energy work supports authentic identity consolidation

**Expected outcome:** Trauma resolution (50-70% improvement); authentic self emergence; unmasking; foundational nervous system healing; readiness for social connection if desired

## PROTOCOL 5: SEVERE MOTOR/ID (PROFOUND DYSREGULATION) SUBTYPE

**Profile:** Significant cognitive + motor limitations; severe sensory/motor dysregulation; often nonverbal/minimally verbal; profound regulation challenges

**Mechanism:** Strong genetic predisposition + strong early trigger (documented) + severe CDR dysregulation

### 5.1 Nutritional Foundation (Primary)

**Rationale:** Severe dysregulation often reflects mitochondrial + nutritional insufficiency

**Protocol:**
- **Probiotics** (daily): restore microbiome → improve absorption + immune
- **Omega-3** (1000-2000 mg/day): neuroinflammation + brain development
- **Magnesium** (100-200 mg/day, divided): cellular energy + regulation
- **B-complex** (daily): mitochondrial function
- **Vitamin D3** (2000-4000 IU/day): immune, mood, development
- **Antioxidants:** NAC (500-1000 mg/day), CoQ10 (100-200 mg/day)
- **Gut healing:** Bone broth, L-glutamine (if tolerance allows)

**Goal:** Optimize mitochondrial function + absorption

### 5.2 Bio-Well GDV Energy Activation (Daily)

**Dosage:** 15-20 min/day, every day

**Mechanism:** Consistent energy field stabilization → nervous system predictability → reduced distress

**Implementation:**
- **Daily scan** (optional, but helpful for caregiver tracking)
- **Activation:** Colors + sounds targeting regulatory meridians
  - Color: Green (calming) + Blue (communication/expression)
  - Sound: 10 Hz (nervous system grounding) + 40 Hz (regulation)
- Presence of caregiver during activation (co-regulation through contact)

**What changes:** Increased periods of calm; reduced distress behaviors; improved communication attempts

### 5.3 Myrion Lamp + Photonic Therapy (Daily)

**Dosage:** 15-20 min/day, every day

**Frequencies:**
- **Primary:** 40 Hz (sensory/motor regulation)
- **Secondary:** 10 Hz (nervous system grounding)
- **Rotation:** Alternate daily to prevent adaptation

**Implementation:**
- Session timed for natural calm moments (not during distress escalation)
- Caregiver presence recommended
- Pitch Crystal placed on chest (heart center stabilization)

**What changes:** Reduction in sensory hypersensitivity; improved motor control possible; more organized behavior

### 5.4 Gentle Movement (3x/week)

**Dosage:** 20-30 min per session, 3x/week

**Types:**
- **Aquatic therapy:** Water + movement, proprioceptive input without overwhelming
- **Music-based movement:** Rhythm provides structure; pleasure motivates participation
- **Hands-on proprioceptive input:** Caregiver-guided deep pressure, stretching

**Mechanism:** Proprioceptive + vestibular input → motor control + regulation capacity improvement

**What changes:** Motor coordination may improve; distress reduced during/after movement; joint mobility maintained

### 5.5 Parental Heart Coherence (Co-Regulation Tool)

**Dosage:** 20 min/day for caregiver (not directly for child)

**Mechanism:** Calm caregiver → calm nervous system signals to child → co-regulation

**Implementation:**
- Caregiver does HeartMath (20 min/day)
- During session, caregiver holds/sits close to child (heart rhythms synchronize)
- Child benefits from caregiver's coherence without requiring active participation

**What changes:** Child's nervous system receives consistent "safe" signals; dysregulation episodes reduce

### 5.6 Anti-Purinergic Support (Optional Medical)

**Consideration:** If above interventions plateau at 8-12 weeks, discuss with developmental pediatrician

**Potential interventions:**
- **Suramin** (investigational but showing promise in Naviaux research): directly calms CDR
- **Natural anti-purinergia:** Quercetin (300-500 mg/day), Apigenin
- **Immunomodulation:** Micronutrient optimization, potentially immunoglobulin support (if immune dysfunction documented)

**Important:** Only pursue with specialist oversight; metabolic biomarkers should guide decisions

### 5.7 Integration + Timeline

**Weeks 1-4:**
- Nutritional foundation (establish daily)
- Bio-Well daily (stabilize energy field)
- Myrion lamp daily (20 min)
- Gentle movement 3x/week
- Parental HeartMath daily (caregiver self-care + co-regulation)

**Weeks 5-8:**
- All above continue
- Assess baseline changes (expect 10-20% reduction in distress behaviors)
- Caregiver reports important (behavior changes; communication attempts; calm periods)

**Weeks 9-12:**
- Continue all interventions
- If plateau: consider anti-purinergic assessment with specialist
- Expect cumulative 20-30% improvement possible

**Weeks 13-24:**
- Ongoing nutritional + energy support (likely lifelong)
- Movement + co-regulation continue indefinitely
- Re-assess annually for functional gains

**Potential outcomes:**
- 30-50% functional improvement in best-case scenarios (depends on CDR reversibility window + severity)
- Sustained comfort/reduced distress
- Enhanced communication attempts
- Improved quality of life (for self + caregivers)

## GENERAL PRINCIPLES ACROSS ALL PROTOCOLS

### Measurement & Adaptation

**Track:**
- Baseline symptom severity (pre-intervention)
- Weekly GDV measurements (if using Bio-Well)
- HeartMath coherence scores (if using app)
- Behavioral changes (journal)
- Functional improvements (ability to engage, communicate, regulate)

**Adapt:**
- If no progress by week 4: assess compliance; consider modification
- If plateau by week 10: add/intensify secondary intervention
- If adverse reaction: reduce intensity; allow nervous system stabilization

### Safety Considerations

**Trauma:** HeartMath can be too activating for severely traumatized individuals; start gentle metta first
**Sensory:** Energy work may be sensory-overwhelming; conduct in quiet, low-stimulus environment
**Medical:** Nutritional/anti-purinergic interventions require healthcare provider consultation
**Individual variation:** Each person's nervous system unique; adjust timelines/intensities accordingly

### Integration with Standard Care

**These protocols complement, not replace:**
- Speech/occupational therapy (skill development)
- Medication (if psychiatric comorbidity present)
- Educational support
- Family therapy

**Best outcomes:** TI biological therapies + standard multimodal approach together
