# Myrion Resolution (MR) - Complete Specification

## Overview

Myrion Resolution is the iterative process for classifying real-world truth states encountered by imperfect agents.

---

## 1. MR is Iterative and Convergent

MR is **NOT** a one-shot truth test.

### The MR Process:

| Stage | Function | Output |
|-------|----------|--------|
| **MR-1** | Filter incoherence | Eliminate Double Tralse (DT) |
| **MR-2** | Classify valid states | True-Tralse, Tralse-False, or Tralse-Indeterminate |
| **MR-3+** | Refine (diminishing returns) | Convergence toward stable classification |

### Key Principles:
- MR is **infinite in principle, finite in practice**
- Action uses **pragmatic convergence**, not metaphysical exhaustion
- Diminishing returns beyond ~3 iterations
- Tralse-Indeterminate is a **legitimate, PD-bounded outcome**

---

## 2. Double Tralse (DT) - A Named, Real State

DT is **NOT Truth**, but it **IS** a real, diagnosable state.

### Definition:
A lack-of-coherence state identified via attempted Myrion Resolution.

### Properties:
- DT typically **collapses at MR-1**
- Refining DT is usually **pointless** (except rare "barely-DT" edge cases)
- DT must be **explicitly named** to distinguish incoherence from weak coherence

### Why Name DT?
Without naming DT, we cannot distinguish:
- Incoherent claims (should be rejected)
- Weakly coherent claims (may be refined)

## 3. Corrected Permissible Domain (PD) Structure

The **Permissible Domain (~80%)** consists of:

| Zone | Range | Description |
|------|-------|-------------|
| **Indeterminate** | 0 | Semantically neutral, admits directional tralse |
| **Approaching Great** | +1 to +1.99 | Positive tendency |
| **Great** | +2 and above | Strongly positive |
| **Approaching Terrible** | -1 to -2.99 | Negative tendency |
| **Terrible** | -3 and below | Strongly negative |

### Asymmetries Are Intentional:
- Great begins at **+2**
- Terrible begins at **-3** (not -2)
- This reflects the **moral asymmetry** of goodness vs. harm

## 4. Dual-PD Evaluation Rule (NEW)

Every MR outcome is evaluated with **two PD values simultaneously**:

1. **Current PD value** (classification)
2. **Residual coherence from MR-1**

### Purpose:
Cleanly distinguishes:
- **Barely coherent claims** (low but non-zero coherence)
- **True DT** (meaningless/incoherent)

### Application:
Essential for paradox handling (e.g., time statements, self-reference).

---

## 5. Paradox Classification

All paradoxes have precise PD values. Some are admissible, others collapse.

### Examples:

| Statement | Classification | PD Value |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| "The future exists" | Tralse-Indeterminate | Low-positive |
| "The present exists alongside the past" | Fragile but admissible | Near-zero |
| "Past, present, and future coexist" | Double Tralse (DT) | Collapses |

### Rule:
- If a statement survives MR-1, it has a valid PD value
- If it collapses at MR-1, it is DT (meaningless under MR)

---

## 6. Ontological Truth vs Expression

### Ontological Truth
- **Absolute and invariant**
- Consists of the most perfect, necessary, coherent entities

### Expression of Truth
- Can vary **probabilistically**
- Examples: cultural goodness, love templates, aesthetic preferences

### Invariant Operators
The following operate regardless of recognition:
- **L–E** (Love × Existence)
- **Tralse–Myrion Logic**

### Resolution:
This resolves the apparent tension between:
- Absolute truth (invariant)
- Observed variation (probabilistic expression)
