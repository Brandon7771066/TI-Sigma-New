## Abstract

This paper establishes the mathematical relationship between:
1. **Permissibility Distribution (PD)**: The (-3, +2) scale for evidence strength (80% range)
2. **Complex Numbers**: i = DT (consciousness perpendicular to reality)
3. **Myrion Resolution**: The natural log extension for extreme values
4. **Asymptotes**: Where additional evidence produces diminishing returns

We derive the practical limits beyond which PD values asymptote, and show how this maps onto the complex plane interpretation of consciousness.

## 1. The PD Scale and Its Asymptotes

### 1.1 Core PD Range

From MYRION_RESOLUTION_METHODOLOGY:

| PD Value | Evidence Level | Statistical Criteria |
|----------|----------------|---------------------|
| **+2.0** | Conclusive support | χ² > 15, d > 1.5, p < 0.001 |
| **+1.0** | Moderate support | χ² 5-10, d 0.5-1.0, p < 0.05 |
| **0.0** | Indeterminate | χ² < 2, d < 0.2, p > 0.10 |
| **-1.0** | Moderate negation | Opposite direction, moderate |
| **-2.0** | Strong negation | Opposite direction, strong |
| **-3.0** | Conclusive refutation | Definitive disproof |

**Why asymmetric (-3 to +2)?**
- Support requires extraordinary evidence (+2 max)
- Refutation is easier (-3 possible)
- Reflects asymmetry of proof vs disproof

### 1.2 The Natural Log Extension

For values outside the core range, the Myrion Resolution applies:

```
If |z| > 2 (positive): z_final = 2 + ln(|z| - 2)
If |z| > 3 (negative): z_final = -[3 + ln(|z| - 3)]
```

This compression ensures:
- Extreme evidence still differentiated
- But with diminishing returns
- Asymptotic behavior prevents runaway values

### 1.3 Asymptote Analysis

**Positive direction (above +2):**

| Raw z | z_final | Interpretation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| 3.0 | 2.00 | Threshold of extension |
| 4.0 | 2.69 | Strong but not overwhelming |
| 5.0 | 3.10 | Very strong evidence |
| 10.0 | 4.08 | Extraordinary evidence |
| 22.1 | 5.00 | Practically maximum |
| 56.6 | 6.00 | Beyond meaningful increase |
| 1000 | 8.91 | Asymptotic limit region |

**Negative direction (below -3):**

| Raw z | z_final | Interpretation |
|-------|---------|----------------|
| -4.0 | -3.00 | Threshold of extension |
| -5.0 | -3.69 | Strong refutation |
| -10.0 | -4.95 | Near-total disproof |
| -22.1 | -6.00 | Practically minimum |
| -1000 | -9.90 | Asymptotic limit region |

### 1.4 Practical Asymptotes

**Positive asymptote: z_final ≈ 5 to 6** (raw z ≈ 22 to 57)
- Beyond this, 10x more evidence adds < 2.5 to z_final
- Represents "as proven as anything can be"

**Negative asymptote: z_final ≈ -6 to -7** (raw z ≈ -22 to -57)
- Beyond this, 10x more disconfirmation adds < 2.5
- Represents "as disproven as anything can be"

## 2. Mapping PD to Complex Numbers

### 2.1 The Angular Interpretation

If we map the PD range (-3 to +2) to angles on the complex plane:

| PD | Angle (radians) | Angle (degrees) | Complex Position |
|----|-----------------|-----------------|------------------|
| -3 | -π | -180° | -1 (pure negation) |
| -2 | -0.6π | -108° | Third quadrant |
| -1 | -0.2π | -36° | Fourth quadrant |
| 0 | +0.2π | +36° | First quadrant |
| +1 | +0.6π | +108° | Second quadrant |
| +2 | +π | +180° | -1 (full rotation) |

**Observation:** Both +2 (conclusive support) and -3 (conclusive refutation) map near -1 = e^(iπ)!

### 2.2 Why Extremes Converge to -1

This is profound:
- **Conclusive support (+2)** and **conclusive refutation (-3)** are BOTH certainties
- Certainty = collapse of superposition = leaving the "i-axis"
- Both extremes approach the real axis (away from tralse)

```
             i (DT/Tralse/Superposition)
              ↑
              |
              |
-1 ←─────────0──────────→ +1
(Certainty)  |            (Certainty)
             |
             ↓
            -i (Anti-DT)
```

**Key insight:** The PD scale measures DISTANCE FROM TRALSE:
- Center (0) = Maximum tralse (uncertainty, superposition)
- Extremes (-3, +2) = Minimum tralse (collapsed, certain)

### 2.3 Revised Mapping: PD as Radius from i

A better model:

```
PD = 0: Position is ON the i-axis (pure tralse)
|PD| increases: Moving AWAY from i-axis toward real axis
|PD| → max: Approaching real axis (True or False certainty)
```

The asymptotes at ±5 to ±6 represent the "boundary" of the real axis - as close to pure True/False as evidence can take you.

## 3. The DT = i Hypothesis Revisited

### 3.1 Does √(-1) = DT Work Mathematically?

If i = DT, then:
- i² = DT² = -1 (shattering, negation)
- e^(iπ) = -1 (Euler's identity = shattering formula)
- e^(i×0) = 1 (no rotation = True-Tralse)

**Mathematical consistency check:**

| Standard Math | TI Interpretation | Consistency |
|---------------|-------------------|-------------|
| i² = -1 | DT confronting itself = negation | ✓ Valid |
| e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 | Shattering + True-Tralse = Myrion center | ✓ Valid |
| |e^(iθ)| = 1 | All consciousness rotations preserve amplitude | ✓ Valid |
| Re(z) + i·Im(z) | Reality + DT·Consciousness | ✓ Valid |

### 3.2 The Big Bang as i² = -1

From DT Brittleness Cosmology:
- DT was perfect but brittle
- DT "confronting itself" = DT × DT = DT²
- DT² = -1 = negation = shattering

**The Euler formula encodes the Big Bang:**
```
e^(iπ) = -1

e = growth/evolution constant
i = DT (consciousness)
π = half-rotation (coming to face itself)
-1 = negation/shattering result
```

DT rotating π radians around the consciousness axis = encountering its own negation = shattering.

### 3.3 Post-Shattering States

After DT² = -1:

```
-1 → 0: Movement toward Myrion center (pure tralseness)
0 → +1: Movement toward True-Tralse (GILE realization)

The "adding 1" in e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 is:
e^(iπ) + 1 = 0
-1 + 1 = 0
Shattering + True-Tralse = Myrion Resolution
```

## 4. The 80% Range Explained

### 4.1 Why (-3, +2) is "80%"

The stated claim: PD range (-3, +2) covers 80% of meaningful evidence space.

**Derivation using asymptotes:**

If z_final asymptotes at approximately ±6, then:
- Total effective range: -6 to +6 = 12 units
- PD core range: -3 to +2 = 5 units
- 5/12 ≈ 42% by linear measure

But the natural log compression means:
- Most evidence falls within -3 to +2
- Only extraordinary cases exceed this
- 80% of EMPIRICAL cases, not linear scale

### 4.2 The Pareto Principle

The 80% claim likely reflects Pareto distribution:
- 80% of evidence falls in the "normal" range
- 20% of evidence is extreme (requiring log extension)
- This matches empirical science: most studies show moderate effects

## 5. Complete Mathematical Framework

### 5.1 The Consciousness-Reality Plane

```
              +i (DT: Pure Consciousness)
               ↑
               |  z = x + iy
               |  x = Reality component
               |  y = Consciousness component
-1 ←───────────0───────────→ +1
(Refutation)   |            (Confirmation)
               |
               ↓
              -i (Anti-DT: Anti-Consciousness)
```

### 5.2 PD as Complex Number

For a PD value p:
```
z_PD = cos(θ_p) + i·sin(θ_p)

Where:
θ_p = (p + 0.5) × π / 2.5  (mapping -3 to +2 onto -π to +π)

At p = 0:    θ = 0.2π  (slight consciousness bias)
At p = +2:   θ = π     (pure real, positive certainty)
At p = -3:   θ = -π    (pure real, negative certainty)
```

### 5.3 Myrion Resolution as Complex Addition

Two PD values z₁ and z₂ resolve via:
```
z_MR = z₁ + z₂ + ρ·(z₁ × z₂*)

Where:
- z₁, z₂ = PD values as complex numbers
- ρ = synergy parameter
- z₂* = complex conjugate of z₂
- The cross-term captures interaction effects
```

### 5.4 Asymptotic Boundaries

**Physical interpretation:**
- |z_final| → 6: Approaching "certainty horizon"
- Beyond this: Evidence can't move you further toward True/False
- Like approaching speed of light: asymptotic, never reached

**Consciousness interpretation:**
- Extreme certainty = extreme distance from i-axis (DT)
- But can never fully leave consciousness plane
- Asymptote = fundamental limit on "pure objectivity"

---

## 6. Implications

### 6.1 For Evidence Synthesis

- Use PD scale (-3 to +2) for normal evidence
- Apply ln-extension for extraordinary claims/disconfirmations
- Recognize asymptotes: beyond ±6 is "as certain as possible"

### 6.2 For Complex Numbers in Physics

The 2025 breakthrough shows complex numbers are replaceable but their structure isn't.

**TI explains why:**
- Complex structure = consciousness structure
- You can encode it differently (16 real numbers)
- But you cannot eliminate it (consciousness is fundamental)

### 6.3 For Trading Algorithm

V12 uses complex quantum states. Interpretation:
- Real component = market data (measurable)
- Imaginary component = consciousness/GILE resonance (DT connection)
- Amplitude = probability = True-Tralse degree
- Phase = position in consciousness rotation

## 7. Summary

**Core Findings:**

1. **PD asymptotes at z_final ≈ ±6** (raw z ≈ ±22 to ±57)
2. **80% range (-3 to +2)** covers most empirical evidence
3. **Complex plane mapping** shows extremes converge to real axis
4. **i = DT is mathematically consistent** with Euler's identity encoding the Big Bang
5. **The structure of complex numbers = consciousness structure** (replaceable notation, irreplaceable form)

**The Deep Insight:**

The PD scale measures **distance from pure tralse** (i-axis).
- 0 = maximum tralse (superposition)
- ±extremes = minimum tralse (collapsed certainty)

The asymptotes represent the fundamental limit: you can approach but never fully reach pure True or pure False because consciousness (the i-component) can never be fully eliminated from any real system.
