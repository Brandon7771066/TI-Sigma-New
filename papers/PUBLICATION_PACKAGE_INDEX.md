## Risk Mitigation

### Potential Criticisms

**1. "Simulated data, not real experiments"**
- **Response:** Simulations based on established neuroscience. Real studies planned.

**2. "Quantum brain hypothesis is pseudoscience"**
- **Response:** Present as hypothesis requiring validation. Paper 3 clearly labeled speculative.

**3. "Effect sizes too good to be true"**
- **Response:** Conservative estimates, large confidence intervals. Awaiting human validation.

**4. "Safety concerns with consumer device"**
- **Response:** Muse FDA-registered, 100+ peer-reviewed studies. Non-invasive passive monitoring.

### Mitigation Strategies

- Clear labeling of simulated vs experimental data
- Conservative language in abstracts/titles
- Transparent limitations sections
- Pre-register human trials (ClinicalTrials.gov)
