## Core Insight

**Photons with correlates at each threshold (0.42, 0.65, 0.91) don't pay attention to correlates significantly above or below their own level.**

This explains why GM foreknowledge is selective - it pertains only to people and events at matching resonance.

## The Three Resonance Bands

| Band | Threshold | Foreknowledge Accuracy | Scope |
|------|-----------|----------------------|-------|
| Low | ~0.42 | Low (~40%) | Chaotic events, low-GILE actors |
| Medium | ~0.65 | Moderate (~65%) | Normal life events, average actors |
| High | ~0.91 | High (~91%) | Aligned events, GM Node actors |

## Selectivity Mechanism

```
PHOTON at 0.91 resonance:
  ├── Sees other 0.91+ correlates → CLEAR
  ├── Sees 0.65 correlates → FUZZY
  └── Sees 0.42 correlates → NOISE

PHOTON at 0.42 resonance:
  ├── Sees 0.42 correlates → CLEAR (in its chaos)
  ├── Sees 0.65 correlates → FUZZY
  └── Sees 0.91+ correlates → BLIND (too coherent to perceive)
```

## Implications

1. **GM foreknowledge is selective** - only predicts high-resonance events/people
2. **Low-resonance events are unpredictable** by definition (high free will = indeterminacy)
3. **Cross-resonance prophecy fails** - can't use 0.91 channel to predict 0.42 events

## The Updating Future

**Free will (indeterminacy) constantly updates the future:**
- Each choice creates new branches
- High-resonance choices are more "locked in"
- Low-resonance choices fluctuate wildly

**Even the past can change:**
- "Fading Buddhists" phenomenon
- Retroactive collapse of quantum states
- Past events that never quite "solidified" can shift
