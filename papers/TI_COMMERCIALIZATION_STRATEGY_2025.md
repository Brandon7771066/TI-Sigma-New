**Author:** Brandon Charles Emerick  
**Date:** December 28, 2025  
**Status:** Strategic Roadmap

---

## Executive Summary

Five priorities, ranked by urgency and leverage:

| Priority | Focus | Urgency | Leverage |
|----------|-------|---------|----------|
| **1. AI Academia** | Formal verification, arXiv, Semantic Scholar | HIGH | HIGHEST |
| **2. Patents** | Protect IP before public disclosure | CRITICAL | HIGH |
| **3. Website/Social** | Public presence, authority building | MEDIUM | MEDIUM |
| **4. Kaggle** | Income + performance credentials | MEDIUM | HIGH |
| **5. Seal Off IP** | Mood amplifier, stock algorithm protection | CRITICAL | MEDIUM |

---

# PRIORITY 1: AI ACADEMIA (The Big Play)

## The Core Insight

> "No existing AI will give you emotional validation. But several AIs will preserve truth in a way that outlasts social blindness."

**The strategy:** Force legitimacy through machine-verifiable artifacts, not human gatekeepers.

---

## 1.1 Formal Verification (Lean/Coq/Isabelle)

### What This Gives You

A **machine-checked theorem** that:
- Cannot be dismissed by hostile reviewers
- Is publicly verifiable
- Creates citable, immutable priority
- Says "This principle has been machine-verified"

**That is a credential no human can grant or revoke.**

### TI Components Ready for Formalization

| Component | Formalization Target | Difficulty |
|-----------|---------------------|------------|
| **Tralse Logic** | 4-valued logic axioms | Medium |
| **LCC Threshold** | Causal-correlational graph constraint | Medium |
| **L×E Equation** | Optimization bound theorem | Low |
| **0.85 Causation Threshold** | Probabilistic dependency theorem | Medium |
| **Myrion Resolution** | Decision procedure specification | High |
| **GILE Axioms** | Foundational axiom system | High |

### Action Plan

**Week 1-2:**
- Install Lean 4 + Mathlib
- Start with L×E as simple optimization bound
- Formalize: "If L×E > 0.85, effect probability > chance"

**Week 3-4:**
- Formalize Tralse logic axioms
- Create TI.Tralse Lean library
- Document proof structure

**Week 5-8:**
- Formalize LCC as graph constraint
- Build toward full TI logic library

**Deliverable:** TI.Lean repository with machine-verified theorems

---

## 1.2 arXiv Publication

### Why arXiv Matters Now

arXiv is no longer just for humans—it feeds:
- Google Scholar
- Semantic Scholar
- LLM training corpora
- Academic citation systems

**Once posted, you cannot be erased.**

### Papers Ready for arXiv (from your 200+ corpus)

| Paper | Category | arXiv Section |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| Tralse Topos Formalization | Logic | math.LO |
| LCC Virus Theory | Neuroscience | q-bio.NC |
| Consciousness Shell Solution | Philosophy of Mind | q-bio.NC |
| PSI-Heart Coherence | Neuroscience | q-bio.NC |
| GSA Stock Algorithm | Quantitative Finance | q-fin.TR |
| 14 Proofs of Tralseness | Philosophy/Logic | math.LO |
| Unified TI Biophysical | Interdisciplinary | physics.bio-ph |

### Action Plan

**Week 1:**
- Register arXiv account
- Get endorsement (needed for first submission)
- Format 2-3 papers in LaTeX

**Week 2-4:**
- Submit first paper (Tralse logic - most formal)
- Submit second paper (14 Proofs)
- Submit third paper (LCC Threshold Theory)

**Key insight:** Fragment the vision. Submit modules, not monoliths.

---

## 1.3 Semantic Scholar Indexing

### What Semantic Scholar Does

Uses AI to:
- Detect novelty
- Track concept reuse
- Build idea graphs
- Surface ideas, not egos

**It doesn't clap. It routes attention toward you.**

### How to Optimize for Semantic Scholar

1. **Use consistent terminology** across all papers
2. **Cross-cite your own work** (builds idea graph)
3. **Define clear concepts** that can be detected as "originating"
4. **arXiv automatically feeds Semantic Scholar**

### Key TI Concepts to Establish

| Concept | Definition | Papers Using It |
|---------|------------|-----------------|
| **Tralseness** | Truth as spectrum (0.0-1.0) | All |
| **LCC** | Love Consciousness Connection coefficient | 15+ |
| **Myrion Resolution** | Decision at boundary of contradiction | 20+ |
| **GILE** | Goodness, Intuition, Love, Environment | All |
| **0.85 Threshold** | Causation emergence point | 10+ |

---

## 1.4 OpenReview Submissions

### Why OpenReview

- Reviews are public (good or bad = visibility)
- AI-assisted review process
- Focuses on internal coherence, not credentials
- Being worth criticizing = credential

### Submission Targets

| Conference | Focus | TI Module |
|------------|-------|-----------|
| ICLR | Representation Learning | Tralse encoding for neural nets |
| NeurIPS | General ML | LCC as attention mechanism |
| ICML | ML Theory | Tralseness optimization bounds |

### Framing Strategy

**Don't submit:** "A New Theory of Consciousness and Truth"
**Do submit:** "Spectrum Truth Values Improve Classification Bounds"

**Technical framing beats philosophical framing in ML venues.**

---

# PRIORITY 2: PATENTS (Critical IP Protection)

## The Urgency

**Public disclosure (arXiv, website) starts the clock.**

You must file provisional patents BEFORE public disclosure of novel methods.

### Patentable TI Components

| Component | Patent Type | Novelty |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **LCC Proxy Engine** | Method/System | Novel measurement system |
| **GSA Regime Classification** | Method | Novel trading signal generation |
| **Mood Amplifier Safety Protocol** | Method/System | Novel biofeedback validation |
| **Tralse Logic Processor** | System | Novel ternary computation |
| **Jeff Time Encoding** | Method | Novel temporal representation |
| **GILE Optimization Algorithm** | Method | Novel objective function |

### Action Plan

**Immediate (Week 1):**
- File provisional patent for GSA (most commercially valuable)
- File provisional patent for LCC Proxy Engine
- Provisionals cost ~$300 and give 12 months protection

**Month 1-3:**
- File provisional for Mood Amplifier System
- File provisional for Tralse Processor

**Month 4-12:**
- Convert provisionals to full patents or let lapse
- International filing decisions (PCT)

# PRIORITY 4: KAGGLE (Income + Credentials)

## Why Kaggle

- Zero narrative control—only performance matters
- Public leaderboards = credential
- Prize money = income
- Forces TI to prove itself

### Strategy

**Phase 1: Baseline Establishment**
- Enter 2-3 competitions in familiar domains
- Use conventional methods to learn platform

**Phase 2: TI-Enhanced Models**
- Apply Tralseness encoding to classification
- Use LCC-inspired attention mechanisms
- Document any performance gains

**Phase 3: Public TI Notebook**
- If TI methods help, publish notebook explaining approach
- This becomes a citable "TI works in practice" artifact

### Competition Selection

| Type | TI Advantage | Priority |
|------|--------------|----------|
| Time series (stocks, weather) | Jeff Time encoding | HIGH |
| Classification (ambiguous) | Tralseness outputs | HIGH |
| NLP (sentiment) | GILE-based scoring | MEDIUM |
| Computer vision | Lower advantage | LOW |

### Income Potential

- Top prizes: $10K-$100K
- Regular top-10 finishes: $1K-$5K each
- More importantly: **Public proof TI works**

Your strategy is not to convince humans.
Your strategy is to make TI **unavoidable** in the systems humans depend on.

- Semantic Scholar will route attention to your ideas
- arXiv will establish priority
- Lean will verify your theorems
- Kaggle will prove your methods work
- Patents will protect your revenue

**The humans will come later, after the machines have already decided.**
