## The TI Insight on Measurement

## Section 6: Training Protocols for Optimization

### 6.1 Brandon's Personal Protocol

**Goal:** Optimize for creativity + PSI + sustained "always on"

**Phase 1 (Weeks 1-4): Baseline & Assessment**
- Daily EEG recordings
- Track natural "on" periods
- Map current profile

**Phase 2 (Weeks 5-8): Alpha Enhancement**
- 20 min alpha training daily
- Target: +25% alpha power
- Concurrent HRV coherence

**Phase 3 (Weeks 9-12): Theta/Alpha Crossover**
- Train toward 7.5-8 Hz crossover
- This is the creativity sweet spot
- Monitor for excessive drowsiness

**Phase 4 (Weeks 13-16): Gamma Training**
- Loving-kindness meditation
- Target: 40 Hz enhancement
- Integration with earlier training

**Phase 5 (Ongoing): Maintenance & Optimization**
- Daily 15-20 min sessions
- State-specific training as needed
- Continue tracking

### 6.2 Quick Optimization Sessions

**5-minute focus boost:**
1. 2 min HRV coherence breathing
2. 3 min eyes-closed SMR visualization
3. Target: Shift theta/beta ratio toward focus

**5-minute creativity boost:**
1. 2 min slow breathing (5 breaths/min)
2. 3 min open-awareness meditation
3. Target: Shift toward alpha/theta crossover

**5-minute PSI prep:**

2. 2 min body scan relaxation
3. 1 min intention setting

## Section 7: Integration with TI Framework

### 7.1 GILE Mapping to Brain States

| GILE | Brain Correlate | Measurement |
|------|----------------|-------------|
| G (Goodness) | Prefrontal activation | Beta at F3, F4 |
| I (Intuition) | Alpha/theta crossover | 7.5-8.5 Hz power |
| L (Love) | Heart-brain coherence | HRV coherence |
| E (Existence) | Gamma integration | 40 Hz power |

### 7.2 L × E Threshold in Neural Terms

```
L = HRV coherence / 100
E = Gamma coherence / 100

L × E > 0.85 requires:
- HRV coherence > 85% AND Gamma coherence > 100%
OR
- HRV coherence > 92% AND Gamma coherence > 92%
etc.

This is the neural signature of reliable manifestation.
```

### 7.3 LCC Coupling as Neural Coherence

**LCC = L × E × (heart-brain phase-lock)**

When heart-brain phase-lock > 0.7:
- HRV and EEG rhythms synchronize
- This IS the LCC coupling mechanism
- Measurable with Polar H10 + Muse 2

## Conclusion

Peak performance in every domain has measurable neurological correlates. The thresholds in this document provide:

1. **Targets for training** - Where to aim
2. **Assessment benchmarks** - Where you are
3. **Domain-specific optimization** - What you need
4. **TI Framework integration** - GILE neural correlates

With Muse 2 + Polar H10, you can measure most of these. The LCC Proxy Engine will help extrapolate the rest.

Train toward your goals. Measure your progress. Optimize your brain.
