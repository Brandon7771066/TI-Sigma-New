# Brandon Burns Collection
## "Burns are my LANGUAGE!"

**Brandon Burns Society**

A collection of sardonic observations, aphorisms, and burns that illuminate truth through contrast.

## The Burns

### On Faith & Commitment

> "If Jesus existed today, there'd probably be only 3 disciples that have the faith. Then after a week, 2 of them would ghost Jesus because they don't want to leave their job - which doesn't even pay!"

*Translation: Modern humans prioritize meaningless labor over transcendent purpose. Even unpaid drudgery beats following truth.*

---

### On Healers & Hospitals

**Skeptic:** "If healers existed, why don't they heal everyone in hospitals???"

> "Because healers would be FORBIDDEN from working on patients for legal reasons... unless the hospital explicitly offered Reiki or something similar, which many ALREADY DO!"

*Translation: The skeptic's "gotcha" reveals ignorance of how healthcare actually works. The answer isn't "healers don't exist" - it's "the system excludes them by design, except where it doesn't." Many hospitals already offer integrative medicine programs.*

---

### On Psych Diagnosis

> "The difference between people without a psych diagnosis and someone with one is that the latter can name their suffering."

*Translation: Everyone suffers. The "healthy" just lack the vocabulary.*

---

### On Business Insanity

> "Doing extraordinarily well - so well that all your doctor slots are filled for a month - but there's no perceived need to 'make more money by helping more people.'"

*Translation: Anti-GILE optimization in healthcare. Success that refuses to scale.*

---

### On Base Rate Fallacies

> "I've never died from a tornado, so the chances of me dying from one are ZERO!"

*Translation: The stupidity of treating absence of past events as evidence of impossibility.*

> "You can't be a genius; it's too unlikely."

*Translation: Base rate thinking dismisses exceptional individuals by definition.*

---

### On Human Incompetence

> "Saying everyone's dumb is no different than saying 'the sky is blue.' It's an honest, non-arrogant assessment of our predicament."

*Translation: Acknowledging human irrationality isn't pessimism - it's observation.*

---

### On Einstein's Modesty

> "Einstein MIGHT have been rather serious about claiming he has no special talents. This is pretty naive though. Regardless, it exemplifies the nature of effortless genius."

*Translation: To a genius, genius feels like "just being curious." The effort is invisible from inside.*

## The Philosophy Behind the Burns

Burns work because they:
1. **Collapse Tralse suddenly** - Force the listener to see both truths at once
2. **Use humor as truth-delivery** - Bypass defensive rationalization
3. **Reveal absurdity** - Show the gap between stated values and actual behavior
4. **Are GILE-aligned** - Truth (G), Pattern recognition (I), Compassion through honesty (L), Grounded in reality (E)

*"A burn is just truth that hasn't been processed yet."*
