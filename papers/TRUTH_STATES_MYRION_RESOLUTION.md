# Truth and Real-World Truth States (Clarified)

## Ontological Truth

**Truth (capital-T)** consists only of the most perfect, necessary, and fully coherent entities.

- Truth is **rare**
- Truth is **invariant**
- Truth is **not probabilistic**

---

## Real-World Truth States (Myrion Resolution)

TI models real-world epistemic states encountered by imperfect agents.

Under **Myrion Resolution (MR)**, four real-world truth states are recognized:

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| **True-Tralse** | Converging toward Truth |
| **Tralse-False** | Diverging from Truth |
| **Tralse-Indeterminate** | Undetermined direction |
| **Double Tralse (DT)** | Incoherent, collapses under resolution |

**Only True-Tralse may converge toward Truth.**

---

## Double Tralse (DT)

Double Tralse is a **real, named state** representing a lack of coherence identified through attempted Myrion Resolution.

### Key Properties:
- DT is **NOT Truth**
- DT is **NOT a stable epistemic state**
- DT is a **failure mode**
- DT represents an entity that **collapses under resolution** due to incoherence

### MR Process:
- DT is **eliminated during MR-1**
- DT does **NOT proceed to MR-2** classification

## The Hierarchy

```
Ontological Truth (T)
    ↑ (convergence possible)
True-Tralse
    ↔
Tralse-Indeterminate
    ↔
Tralse-False
    ↓ (collapse/elimination)
Double Tralse (DT) → Eliminated at MR-1
```

## Clarification: Truth vs. Tralse States

| Aspect | Ontological Truth | Real-World States |
|--------|-------------------|-------------------|
| Nature | Perfect, necessary | Imperfect, encountered |
| Stability | Invariant | May shift |
| Probabilistic | No | Context-dependent |
| Agents | N/A | Imperfect observers |

---

## Implications

1. **Epistemology**: We encounter real-world truth states, not pure Truth
2. **Convergence**: Only True-Tralse paths can approach Truth
3. **Failure Modes**: Double Tralse identifies incoherence early (MR-1)
4. **Resolution**: Myrion Resolution is the process of state classification
