# Permissible Domain (PD) Thresholds - Corrected Specification

## Overview

The Permissible Domain represents the ~80% of real-world truth states that are neither purely True nor purely False.

## PD Structure

| Zone | PD Range | Description |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Great** | ≥ +2 | Strongly positive, approaching Truth |
| **Approaching Great** | +1 to +1.99 | Positive tendency |
| **Indeterminate** | ~0 | Semantically neutral |
| **Approaching Terrible** | -1 to -2.99 | Negative tendency |
| **Terrible** | ≤ -3 | Strongly negative, approaching False |

## Key Asymmetries

### Why +2 for Great but -3 for Terrible?

The asymmetry is **intentional and meaningful**:

1. **Moral Asymmetry**: It's harder to cause great good than great harm
2. **Precautionary Principle**: Negative states require more evidence before labeling "Terrible"
3. **GILE Alignment**: Reflects G (Goodness) dimension priority

### Numeric Rationale:
- Great threshold: +2 (clear positive)
- Terrible threshold: -3 (must be clearly harmful, not just negative)
- Buffer zone: -1 to -2.99 is "Approaching Terrible" (warning, not condemnation)

## Indeterminate Zone

**Indeterminate is NOT failure.**

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| PD Value | ~0 |
| Meaning | Semantically neutral |
| Status | Legitimate MR-2 outcome |
| Action | May refine in MR-3+ |

### Directional Tralse:
Even Indeterminate claims admit directional characterization:
- **Tral-leaning** (∇): Likely to resolve toward True-Tralse
- **Fals-leaning** (Δ): Likely to resolve toward Tralse-False

## Dual-PD Evaluation

Every MR outcome carries **two PD values**:

| PD Type | Source | Purpose |
|---------|--------|---------|
| **Current PD** | MR-2 classification | Where the claim stands now |
| **Residual Coherence** | MR-1 survival | How much coherence remains |

### Example:
| Claim | Current PD | Residual Coherence | Interpretation |
|-------|------------|-------------------|----------------|
| "Free will exists" | +1.2 (Approaching Great) | High | Solid claim, positive direction |
| "Time is an illusion" | 0 (Indeterminate) | Low | Fragile, barely coherent |
| "Square circles exist" | N/A | Zero | DT, eliminated at MR-1 |

---

## PD and Truth States

| PD Zone | Likely Truth State |
|---------|-------------------|
| Great (+2+) | True-Tralse |
| Approaching Great | True-Tralse (tentative) |
| Indeterminate | Tralse-Indeterminate |
| Approaching Terrible | Tralse-False (tentative) |
| Terrible (-3-) | Tralse-False |

---

## Application Examples

### Ethics:
| Action | PD Value | Zone |
|--------|----------|------|
| Save a life | +3 | Great |
| Be kind | +1.5 | Approaching Great |
| Neutral act | 0 | Indeterminate |
| Minor harm | -1.5 | Approaching Terrible |
| Murder | -4 | Terrible |

### Epistemology:
| Claim | PD Value | Zone |
|-------|----------|------|
| "2+2=4" | N/A | Pure Truth (outside PD) |
| "Consciousness exists" | +2.5 | Great |
| "Dark matter exists" | +0.5 | Approaching Great |
| "Astrology predicts" | -2 | Approaching Terrible |
| "Earth is flat" | -4 | Terrible |

---

## Summary

| Threshold | Value | Direction |
|-----------|-------|-----------|
| Great begins | +2 | Positive |
| Terrible begins | -3 | Negative |
| Asymmetry | Intentional | Moral/precautionary |
