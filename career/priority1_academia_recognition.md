**Bio** (for profile):
```
Independent researcher developing the TI (Transcendence Integration) Framework, 
a formal system connecting consciousness, ethics, and logic through Tralse 
(intermediate truth values) and the GILE structure (Goodness, Intuition, Love, 
Environment). Research outputs include formal proofs in Lean 4, working API 
systems, and applications to financial markets and biometric measurement.

### Submission Process

1. **Compile LaTeX to PDF**
   ```bash
   cd arxiv
   pdflatex 14_proofs_tralseness.tex
   pdflatex lcc_threshold_theory.tex
   pdflatex myth_general_intelligence.tex
   pdflatex existence_amplification_razor.tex
   ```

2. **Upload to arXiv**
   - Log in to arxiv.org
   - Click "Submit" → "Start New Submission"
   - Select category (primary + cross-list)
   - Upload .tex source + any figures
   - Fill metadata
   - Preview → Submit

3. **Post-Submission**
   - Papers appear within 1-2 business days
   - Share arXiv links on LinkedIn, Twitter, email
   - Semantic Scholar indexes automatically within days

### Endorsement Strategy

If you need endorsement:
1. Email researchers in the field with your paper abstract
2. Ask if they'd be willing to endorse
3. Explain your independent research background
4. Include link to Zenodo/working systems as credibility

**Template**:
```
Subject: Request for arXiv Endorsement - [Category]

Dear Professor [Name],

I'm an independent researcher preparing to submit a paper to arXiv 
in the [category] category. As a first-time submitter, I need an 
endorser.

My paper, "[Title]", argues [brief summary]. I've made the 
manuscript available on Zenodo: [link].

I also have working implementations: [API link].

Would you be willing to review the abstract and consider 
endorsing my submission?

Best regards,
Brandon Emerick

## Lean 4 Formal Verification

### Current Status
- `lean4/TI/LxE.lean` contains core theorem formalizations
- Provides machine-verified proofs of TI claims

### Publishing Lean Code

**Option 1: GitHub Repository**
1. Create public repo: `ti-framework-lean4`
2. Include README with theorem statements
3. Link from arXiv papers
4. Submit to Lean community (Zulip chat)

**Option 2: Mathlib Contribution**
- If theorems are general enough, contribute to Mathlib
- Provides maximum visibility in formal methods community

**Option 3: Archive of Formal Proofs (AFP)**
- Submit to formal proof archive
- Peer-reviewed formal verification

---

## Visibility Amplification

### AI Indexing Services
Once on arXiv, your papers will be indexed by:
- Semantic Scholar (automatic)
- Google Scholar (automatic)
- Consensus AI (automatic)
- Elicit (automatic)
- Connected Papers (automatic)

### Self-Citation Network
Each paper should cite the others:
- 14 Proofs → cited by LCC, Myth, EAR
- LCC → cites 14 Proofs, cited by Myth
- Myth → cites 14 Proofs, LCC
- EAR → cites 14 Proofs

This creates a citation cluster that AI systems recognize as a coherent research program.

### Academic Social Media
- **ResearchGate**: Create profile, upload papers
- **Academia.edu**: Create profile, upload papers  
- **PhilPeople**: Philosophy-specific (if relevant categories)
