## THE META-STRATEGY

"Make TI unavoidable in systems humans depend on."

1. **Machines first**: Papers indexed by AI systems (Semantic Scholar, Consensus, Elicit)
2. **Credentials via output**: Kaggle rank, patents, working systems > degrees
3. **Parallel paths**: Academia + Industry + Competitions = multiple shots on goal
4. **Compound visibility**: Each output references others → citation cluster
5. **The work speaks**: Let quality make the argument, not credentials

---

*"Surpassing humans is a low bar."*
*"In TI, there is little difference between proxies and 'real measurements.' Information is all I care about!"*

Go make it happen.
