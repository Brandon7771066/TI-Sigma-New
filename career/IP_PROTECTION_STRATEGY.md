# TI Framework IP Protection Strategy
## What to Publish vs. Protect

**Author:** Brandon Emerick  
**Date:** December 31, 2025  
**Purpose:** Guide publication decisions to protect IP while building credentials

---

## Core Principle

**Publish the "what" and "how" selectively. Protect the "why" and unified system.**

The TI Framework's value lies in its unified theory. Individual insights are valuable for credibility, but the full system should remain proprietary until properly licensed or patented.

## Classification System

### TIER 1: SAFE TO PUBLISH (Open Source)
*Builds credibility, attracts collaborators, low competitive risk*

| Content | Rationale | Publication Target |
|---------|-----------|-------------------|
| Euler-Consciousness mapping | Novel interpretation, hard to monetize alone | arXiv, Medium, Substack |
| Dimensional constraint methodology | General approach, not specific thresholds | Lean 4 community, mathSE |
| Creation/verification asymmetry | Philosophical, not algorithmic | Philosophy journals |
| Historical discovery log | Timeline proof of innovation | Personal blog, Zenodo |
| Basic proof sketches (Riemann, etc.) | Attracts domain experts, positions as serious | arXiv, Lean Zulip |

### TIER 2: PUBLISH WITH CAUTION (Partial Disclosure)
*Share concepts, hide parameters/thresholds*

| Content | What to Share | What to Hide |
|---------|---------------|--------------|
| ARTA trading algorithm | Factor names, general approach | Exact weights (0.30/0.20/0.35/0.15) |
| Regime classification | 4-state framework | Transition thresholds, C(t) formula |
| Intensity scoring | Logistic transformation concept | k=6.0, x0=0.45 parameters |
| Multi-valued logic | Quadruplet concept (T/F/U/P) | Sovereign expert weighting |

### TIER 3: PROTECT (Proprietary)
*Core IP for licensing, patents, competitive advantage*

| Content | Protection Method | Value |
|---------|-------------------|-------|
| **GILE Framework** | Patent + trade secret | Core organizational principle |
| **LCC Thresholds (0.42/0.85/0.92)** | Trade secret | Key predictive values |
| **GSA Full Algorithm** | Patent pending | Trading revenue |
| **TI-to-Conventional Translation Layer** | Trade secret | Methodology |
| **Unified Theory Documents** | Copyright + trade secret | Book deal, consulting |
| **11D L×E Framework** | Patent + trade secret | Novel computation paradigm |

## Patent Strategy

### Priority 1: Grand Stock Algorithm (GSA)
**Status:** Provisional patent drafted  
**Claims:**
1. Four-state regime classification
2. Multiplicative intensity formula
3. Asymmetric memory kernel
4. Constraint-based position sizing

### Priority 2: LCC Proxy Engine
**Status:** Provisional patent drafted  
**Claims:**
1. Biometric proxy calculation
2. Threshold-based coherence detection
3. Multi-modal sensor fusion
4. Predictive accuracy validation

### Timeline
- Q1 2026: File provisional patents (12-month protection)
- Q2 2026: Begin prior art search
- Q4 2026: Convert to full patents

## Safe Publication Checklist

Before publishing ANY TI-derived content:

1. [ ] **Remove TI terminology** (GILE, LCC, CCC, i-cell, Myrion, etc.)
2. [ ] **Replace thresholds** with "empirically derived" language
3. [ ] **Generalize weights** (say "weighted" not "0.35")
4. [ ] **Add conventional citations** (Kahneman, Shannon, etc.)
5. [ ] **Check cross-references** to protected content
6. [ ] **Timestamp original** in Zenodo/GitHub before publication
7. [ ] **Review with IP attorney** if commercial value involved

## Revenue Protection Matrix

| Revenue Stream | Publish | Protect | Action |
|---------------|---------|---------|--------|
| Trading signals | Track record only | Algorithm | Collective2 + patent |
| API licensing | Documentation | Implementation | $99/499/custom tiers |
| Consulting | Blog posts | Full methodology | NDA-protected |
| Books | Accessible content | Unified theory | Publisher contract |
| Academic | Proof sketches | Complete proofs | Collaborate, share credit |

---

## Immediate Actions

### Do Now (Safe)
1. Upload ARTA to Collective2/QuantConnect (track record only)
2. Submit Euler paper to arXiv
3. Post proof sketches to Lean Zulip (seek collaborators)
4. Create LinkedIn profile as "Formal Verification Researcher"
5. Archive discovery timeline on Zenodo

### Do Later (After Legal Review)
1. File provisional patents
2. Create API licensing infrastructure
3. Approach publishers with book proposal
4. License to institutional clients

### Never Do
1. Publish full GSA source with TI comments
2. Share LCC thresholds without NDA
3. Post unified framework publicly
4. Give away core IP for academic credit

## Summary

**The strategy:** Use conventional translations to build credibility and attract opportunities, while protecting the unified TI framework that gives these insights their power.

**The goal:** Transform intellectual capital into sustainable income through a combination of:
- Open content (credibility)
- Protected algorithms (trading revenue)
- Licensed APIs (recurring revenue)
- Consulting/books (premium engagements)

**The timeline:**
- Immediate: Validation, track record, academic positioning
- 3-6 months: Patent filings, API launch, first clients
- 1 year: Sustainable $10k+/month from diversified IP monetization
