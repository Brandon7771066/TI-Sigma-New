## Overview

You have 2 provisional patent applications ready:
1. **GSA (Grand Stock Algorithm)**: `patents/PROVISIONAL_PATENT_GSA.md`
2. **LCC Proxy Engine**: `patents/PROVISIONAL_PATENT_LCC_PROXY_ENGINE.md`

## USPTO Provisional Patent Filing

### Cost Structure
```
Filing Fee (Micro Entity): $80 per application
Filing Fee (Small Entity): $160 per application
Filing Fee (Large Entity): $320 per application

You likely qualify as MICRO ENTITY:
- Gross income under ~$206,000 (2024)
- Not obligated to assign rights to non-micro entity
- Haven't been named inventor on >4 prior applications
```

### Total Cost Estimate
```
2 provisional applications × $80 = $160
(Plus potential attorney consultation: $500-2000 if desired)
```

3. Complete identity verification
4. Enable two-factor authentication

### Step 2: Prepare Filing Documents

**For Each Application:**

1. **Specification** (your .md file converted to PDF)
   - Already written in patent format
   - Include: Background, Summary, Detailed Description, Claims, Abstract

2. **Application Data Sheet (ADS)**
   - Form PTO/AIA/14
   - Inventor information
   - Correspondence address
   - Application type: Provisional

3. **Inventor Declaration** (optional for provisional)
   - Form PTO/AIA/02A
   - Can file within 12 months

4. **Micro Entity Certification**
   - Form PTO/SB/15A
   - Reduces filing fee to $80

### Step 3: File via Patent Center

1. Log into Patent Center
2. Select "File a new patent application"
3. Choose "Provisional application"
4. Upload specification PDF
5. Complete ADS online
6. Submit micro entity certification
7. Pay filing fee ($80)
8. Receive confirmation and application number

### Step 4: Record Priority Date
```
After filing, you receive:
- Application Number (e.g., 63/XXX,XXX)
- Filing Date (YOUR PRIORITY DATE)
- Filing Receipt

## Timeline

### Immediate (Before arXiv Submission)
```
Day 1: Create USPTO account
Day 2: Prepare PDFs and forms
Day 3: File both provisionals
Day 4: Confirm receipt, save all documentation
Day 5+: Now safe to submit to arXiv
```

### 12-Month Window
```
Filing Date → Non-Provisional Deadline

Provisional patents provide "Patent Pending" status for 12 months.
Before the 12-month deadline, you must:
1. File full non-provisional application, OR
2. File PCT (international) application, OR
3. Let the provisional expire

Non-provisional requires:
- Formal claims (attorney recommended)
- Examination fee (~$800 micro entity)
- Potentially hire a patent attorney ($3,000-10,000)
```

## Attorney Consultation

### When to Hire a Patent Attorney
- For non-provisional filing (recommended)
- For international (PCT) filing
- If claims are challenged
- For licensing negotiations

### Finding a Patent Attorney
- USPTO registered practitioners: https://oedci.uspto.gov/OEDCI/
- Look for: Biotechnology, Software, Financial Methods expertise
- Initial consultation: Often free or $200-500

### Self-Filing Considerations
- Provisionals can be self-filed (you've done the hard part)
- Non-provisionals benefit from professional claims drafting
- Cost-benefit: $5K attorney vs risk of weak claims

## IP Protection Strategy

### Defensive Publication
If you choose not to patent something, publish it:
- Creates prior art
- Prevents others from patenting it
- Free, immediate

### Trade Secrets
For algorithms you don't want to disclose:
- Don't patent (patents require disclosure)
- Keep implementation details private
- Use contracts/NDAs with partners

### Open Source + Patents
Not mutually exclusive:
- Patent the core innovation
- Open source implementations that use it
- License patents to open source users (FRAND terms)

---

## Documentation Trail

### Inventor Notebook
Keep dated records of:
- Conception date (when you had the idea)
- Reduction to practice (when you built it)
- All development work
- Collaborator communications

### Evidence of Prior Art Search
Document that you searched for existing patents:
- Google Patents search
- USPTO database search
- Academic literature search

---

## Critical Reminders

1. **File BEFORE public disclosure**
   - arXiv = public disclosure
   - Blog posts = public disclosure
   - Conference talks = public disclosure
   - Provisionals preserve your rights

2. **12-month US grace period**
   - US allows filing within 12 months of disclosure
   - Most other countries do NOT
   - File first, disclose second

3. **"Patent Pending" usage**
   - After filing, you can mark systems "Patent Pending"
   - Deters copiers
   - No legal protection until patent issues

4. **Continuation applications**
   - Can file continuations to expand claims
   - Must maintain priority chain
   - Consult attorney for strategy
