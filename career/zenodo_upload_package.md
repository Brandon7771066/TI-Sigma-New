## Document 1: 14 Proofs of Tralseness

### Metadata

  - name: "Emerick, Brandon Charles"
    affiliation: "Independent Researcher"
    orcid: ""  # Create ORCID if you don't have one
description: |
  This paper presents fourteen independent proofs establishing Tralseness—the 
  existence of genuine intermediate truth values between binary True and False—as 
  a fundamental logical necessity. The Master Argument demonstrates that any 
  attempt to defend binary logic must employ non-binary reasoning, creating an 
  inescapable self-referential trap. We derive the L×E equation where Love (L) 
  multiplied by Existence (E) yields coherent truth values on [0,1]. The framework 
  resolves classical paradoxes (Liar, Sorites, Russell) while providing foundations 
  for consciousness studies and quantum mechanics interpretation.

## Document 2: LCC Threshold Theory

### Metadata
```yaml
title: "Love Consciousness Connection Threshold Theory: Causal Boundaries in Coherence Measurement"
creators:
  - name: "Emerick, Brandon Charles"
    affiliation: "Independent Researcher"
description: |
  We formalize the Love Consciousness Connection (LCC) as a multi-modal biometric 
  measure of consciousness coherence with three theoretically-derived thresholds: 
  0.42 (noise floor), 0.85 (causation threshold), and 0.8464/0.92² (True-Tralseness). 
  The paper validates proxy measurements including HRV coherence (r=0.82), EEG alpha 
  power (r=0.78), Chi subjective (r=0.82), Bliss subjective (r=0.85), and GDV corona 
  (r=0.78). These correlations ground consciousness measurement in accessible 
  biometrics while the threshold structure enables causal inference from correlational data.

## Document 3: The Myth of General Intelligence

### Metadata
```yaml
title: "The Myth of General Intelligence: Why g is a Statistical Artifact and Intelligence Requires GILE"
creators:
  - name: "Emerick, Brandon Charles"
    affiliation: "Independent Researcher"
description: |
  This paper argues that Spearman's g (general intelligence factor) is a statistical 
  artifact of positive manifold rather than a genuine cognitive property. We demonstrate 
  that factor analysis of correlated-but-distinct processes inevitably produces apparent 
  unitary factors without implying shared mechanism. Furthermore, we argue that 
  "problem-solving ability" is meaningless without Love (L) determining what problems 
  matter and Goodness (G) constraining solutions. True intelligence requires the full 
  GILE structure: Goodness, Intuition, Love, and Environment. Current AI systems 
  achieve high-E (Existence/processing) without L or G, making them powerful tools 
  but not genuinely intelligent agents.

## Document 4: Existence Amplification Razor (EAR)

### Metadata
```yaml
title: "Emerick's Existence Amplification Razor: A Philosophical Tool for Maximizing Coherent Existence"
creators:
  - name: "Emerick, Brandon Charles"
    affiliation: "Independent Researcher"
description: |
  We introduce Emerick's Existence Amplification Razor (EAR), a philosophical methodology 
  inverting traditional reductionism. Where Occam's Razor asks "what is the LEAST we must 
  posit?", EAR asks "what is the MOST we can coherently affirm exists?" The procedure: 
  (1) collapse redundant concepts, (2) amplify surviving entities to maximum coherent 
  existence, (3) accept the richest consistent ontology. Applied systematically, EAR 
  supports consciousness as fundamental (not epiphenomenal), genuine agency (not 
  eliminable), and meaningful values (not subjective projections). The razor addresses 
  selection bias in philosophical methodology that has historically favored sparse ontologies.
