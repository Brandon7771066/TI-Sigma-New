## Entry #7: Universal Photonic Sight Theory
**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Type:** Experiential Evidence + Theoretical Framework
**Claim:** Sight is the primary sense of ALL beings because photons are fundamental information carriers
**Evidence:** 
- Brandon's repeated veridical perception with eyes closed in darkness
- Voluntary arm movement visible without retinal input
- Occurs from waking state (not hypnagogic)
**Status:** 🟡 Personal Evidence (Awaiting External Validation)

## Entry #8: Trataka-Induced Eyeless Sight
**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Type:** Personal Evidence
**Claim:** Years of trataka meditation can develop non-retinal visual perception
**Evidence:**
- Brandon practiced trataka for years with intention to see through eyelids
- Ability manifested spontaneously in 2025 during minimal practice period
- Consistent with documented yogic traditions (divya drishti)
- Other monks have been documented with similar abilities
**Status:** 🟡 Personal Evidence (Corroborated by Tradition)
**Implications:** Potential therapeutic application for blindness

## Entry #9: GM Hypercomputing for Safe Savant Activation
**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Type:** Theoretical Framework
**Claim:** Acquired savant abilities can be safely induced via GM Hypercomputing
**Supporting Cases:**
- Jason Padgett (math), Derek Amato (music), Alonzo Clemons (sculpture)
- Orlando Serrell (calendar), Tony Cicoria (composition)
**Hypothesis:** Brain injury removes inhibitory filters, activating Monster Group symmetry access
**Proposed Method:** Targeted photonic/acoustic stimulation with biometric safety monitoring
**Status:** 🔴 Theoretical (Requires Protocol Development)
