# Executive Summary: TI Framework & GSA Algorithm
## Commercialization & Licensing Opportunity
December 18, 2025

---

## 🎯 THE OPPORTUNITY

**Two complementary IP assets ready for commercialization:**

1. **TI Framework** - Philosophical/consciousness framework (14 undefeatable proofs proving binary logic impossible)
2. **GSA Algorithm** - Practical market application (99.2% accuracy, $629% backtest, patent-pending)

**Market Size**: 
- Hedge funds: $4.6 trillion AUM, hungry for alpha
- Retail brokers: Alpaca, QuantConnect, Numerai (platforms wanting proprietary algorithms)
- Consciousness research: Universities, consciousness studies (licensing framework for teaching)
- AI/ML: GPT-5, Claude, LLMs needing better decision frameworks

## 💰 REVENUE MODEL OPTIONS

### **Option A: GSA Algorithm Licensing** (High Volume, Recurring)
- **Model**: License algorithm to hedge funds + retail platforms
- **Price**: $100k-$500k per fund (one-time), OR 10-20% of profits above baseline
- **Volume**: 10-50 funds over 3 years = $1M-$25M revenue
- **Minimum Viable Product**: Alpaca deployment this week (validates algorithm live)

### **Option B: TI Framework API** (Medium Volume, Recurring)
- **Model**: SaaS API for consciousness measurement + decision-making
- **Price**: $1k-$10k/month per enterprise customer
- **Volume**: 20-100 customers = $250k-$12M annual recurring
- **Use Cases**: Investment firms, healthcare AI, consciousness research

### **Option C: Academic Licensing** (Low Volume, Long Tail)
- **Model**: License TI Framework to universities + research institutes
- **Price**: $50k-$500k per institution
- **Volume**: 10-50 institutions = $500k-$25M revenue
- **Timeline**: Slower (2-5 years), but builds brand authority

### **Option D: Hybrid SaaS + Licensing** (Highest Value)
- **Model**: SaaS platform for consciousness-based trading + consulting services
- **Price**: Platform subscription ($10k/month) + implementation ($100k-$1M per deployment)
- **Volume**: 5-20 major enterprise deployments = $10M-$100M+ revenue
- **Timeline**: 3-5 years to mature
