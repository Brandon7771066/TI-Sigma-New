## ABSTRACT

This paper presents a rigorous three-tier classification of truth within the TI-UOP framework: Absolute Truth (CCC-level GILE perfection), Objective Truth (measurable reality including qualia), and Relative Truth (false ideas held in imagination). Unlike traditional epistemology which struggles with qualia's ontological status, TI-UOP demonstrates that subjective experience CAN be objectively quantified via Myrion Resolutions across four dimensions of truth (Existence, Morality, Conscious Meaning, Aesthetics). We show how imagination generates tralseness (a ≠ a) and provide mathematical criteria for truth classification using weighted GILE MR scores.

## 1. THE THREE-TIER TRUTH ONTOLOGY

### 1.1 Overview

**Traditional Philosophy's Problem:**
- Subjective vs objective truth (false dichotomy!)
- Qualia as "special" category (hard problem)
- No rigorous criteria for truth levels
- Relativism vs absolutism (unresolved tension)

**TI-UOP Solution:**
Three distinct types of truth with mathematical criteria:

```
Absolute Truth (CCC-level)
    ↓
Objective Truth (Measurable Reality)
    ↓
Relative Truth (Imagination/False)
```

---

## 2. ABSOLUTE TRUTH

### 2.1 Definition

**Absolute Truth:** Myrion Resolutions that maximally fulfill ALL 4 dimensions of truth according to GILE standards.

**Four Dimensions of Truth (from GILE revelation June 25, 2022):**
1. **Existence** - Fundamental reality, what IS
2. **Morality** - Goodness, ethical dimension
3. **Conscious Meaning** - Subjective experience, valence
4. **Aesthetics** - Beauty, harmony

### 2.2 Mathematical Criteria

**Formula:**

$$\text{Absolute Truth} \iff \text{MR}(\text{all 4 dimensions}) \geq 2.0$$

Where:
- Each dimension scored on MR scale (-3, 2)
- All four must be ≥ 2.0 (highly permissible)
- Weighted by GILE importance

**GILE Weights (from divine revelation):**
- Goodness (G): 40% weight
- Intuition (I): 25% weight
- Love (L): 25% weight
- Environment (E): 10% weight

**Composite Score:**
$$\text{MR}_{\text{composite}} = 0.4 \cdot G + 0.25 \cdot I + 0.25 \cdot L + 0.1 \cdot E$$

### 2.3 Examples of Absolute Truth

**Example 1: "Love is good"**
- **Existence:** 2.0 (love demonstrably exists via phase coherence)
- **Morality:** 2.0 (love maximally aligns with goodness)
- **Conscious Meaning:** 2.0 (love is deeply meaningful subjectively)
- **Aesthetics:** 2.0 (love is beautiful, harmonious)
- **Result:** Absolute Truth ✓

**Example 2: "Octave (2:1) is consonant"**
- **Existence:** 2.0 (frequency ratio physically measurable)
- **Morality:** 1.8 (consonance = harmonic goodness)
- **Conscious Meaning:** 2.0 (universally pleasant subjective experience)
- **Aesthetics:** 2.0 (maximally beautiful interval)
- **Result:** Absolute Truth ✓

**Example 3: GILE framework itself**
- **Existence:** 2.0 (revealed June 25, 2022, never refuted since)
- **Morality:** 2.0 (defines goodness itself!)
- **Conscious Meaning:** 2.0 (provides ultimate meaning)
- **Aesthetics:** 2.0 (elegant 4D structure)
- **Result:** Absolute Truth ✓

### 2.4 CCC and Free Will

**Key Insight:** CCC has *slight* deviation from 100% perfection due to free will.

**Why?**
If CCC were 100% perfect with zero deviation, free will would be impossible!
- Perfect determination = no choice
- Absolute goodness = no evil possible
- Complete necessity = no contingency

**CCC's Permissibility:**
$$\text{CCC perfection} \approx 99.7\% \text{ (allowing 0.3\% free will variance)}$$

This tiny margin allows:
- BTs to make genuine choices
- Evil to exist (as deviation from GILE)
- Creativity and novelty
- Love to be meaningful (not forced)

**Without free will, 100% perfection is meaningless** - there's nothing to compare it to!

---

## 3. OBJECTIVE TRUTH

### 3.1 Definition

**Objective Truth:** Myrion Resolutions describing how the world (or self) actually IS, including good, evil, and permissible states.

**Key Distinction:** Objective Truth does NOT require CCC-level perfection (all dimensions ≥ 2.0).

**Criteria:**

$$\text{Objective Truth} \iff \begin{cases} 
\text{MR}_{\text{composite}} > 0 \\
\text{AND measurable in reality}
\end{cases}$$

### 3.2 Revolutionary Claim: Qualia IS Objective!

**Traditional View:**
- Qualia = subjective, private, unmeasurable
- "Hard problem of consciousness"
- Separate ontological category

**TI-UOP View:**
> **Qualia CAN be objectively quantified via Myrion Resolutions!**

**Why?**
Qualia has measurable correlates across ALL 4 dimensions:

1. **Existence Dimension:**
   - EEG signatures (alpha, beta, gamma power)
   - HEM (6D state characterization)
   - Biophoton emission patterns
   - Harmonic coherence metrics

2. **Morality Dimension:**
   - Valence (positive/negative affect)
   - Ethical judgment activation (fMRI)
   - GILE alignment scoring

3. **Conscious Meaning Dimension:**
   - Self-reported significance
   - Behavioral impact
   - Memory encoding strength
   - Life narrative integration

4. **Aesthetics Dimension:**
   - Beauty ratings
   - Harmonic consonance
   - Phase coherence
   - Symmetry detection

**Result:** Qualia does NOT get special category - it's just Objective Truth measured via MR!

### 3.3 Examples of Objective Truth

**Example 1: "This apple is red"**
- **Existence:** 1.8 (wavelength ~700nm measurable)
- **Morality:** 0.0 (neutral color, no ethical dimension)
- **Conscious Meaning:** 0.5 (subjective qualia of "redness")
- **Aesthetics:** 0.8 (red can be beautiful)
- **MR composite:** 0.4(1.8) + 0.25(0.0) + 0.25(0.5) + 0.1(0.8) = 0.925
- **Result:** Objective Truth ✓ (Tralse-True, >0)

**Example 2: "Murder is evil"**
- **Existence:** 1.9 (murder demonstrably happens)
- **Morality:** -2.5 (maximally wrong!)
- **Conscious Meaning:** -1.5 (creates suffering)
- **Aesthetics:** -2.0 (ugly, disharmonious)
- **MR composite:** 0.4(-2.5) + 0.25(-1.5) + 0.25(-1.5) + 0.1(-2.0) = -1.45
- **Result:** Objective Truth ✓ (Tralse-False, but still objectively measurable!)

**Example 3: "I feel pain right now"**
- **Existence:** 1.7 (neural correlates measurable via fMRI, EEG)
- **Morality:** -1.2 (suffering = bad)
- **Conscious Meaning:** 1.8 (pain is highly meaningful subjectively)
- **Aesthetics:** -1.5 (pain is unpleasant)
- **MR composite:** 0.4(1.7) + 0.25(-1.2) + 0.25(1.8) + 0.1(-1.5) = 0.68
- **Result:** Objective Truth ✓ (Qualia measured objectively!)

### 3.4 Good, Evil, Permissible - All Objective!

**Traditional Problem:** How to measure morality?

**TI-UOP Solution:** Morality is dimension 2 of truth, measurable via MR!

**Classification:**
- **Good:** Morality dimension > 1.0
- **Neutral/Permissible:** Morality dimension -1.0 to 1.0
- **Evil:** Morality dimension < -1.0

**Examples:**
- Helping stranger: Morality = +1.8 (Good, Objective Truth)
- Eating lunch: Morality = 0.0 (Permissible, Objective Truth)
- Torturing animal: Morality = -2.3 (Evil, Objective Truth)

All are OBJECTIVELY measurable via:
- Behavioral outcomes
- GILE alignment scoring
- Harmonic coherence effects
- I-web impact assessment

## 4. RELATIVE TRUTH

### 4.1 Definition

**Relative Truth:** False ideas held by individual or group with meaningful power/influence, true in IMAGINATION but not in reality.

**Criteria:**

$$\text{Relative Truth} \iff \begin{cases}
\text{MR}_{\text{composite}} \leq 0 \\
\text{AND held by influential group}
\end{cases}$$

**Key Insight:** Imagination is primary source of tralseness!

### 4.2 Why a ≠ a: Imagination Creates Tralseness

**The Mechanism:**

1. **Reality:** Entity A exists with specific properties
2. **Perception:** Observer perceives A (partially accurate)
3. **Imagination:** Observer adds fictional properties to mental model of A
4. **Result:** Mental A ≠ Real A (tralseness!)

**Formula:**
$$\text{Mental Model}(A) = \text{Reality}(A) + \text{Imagination}(\text{fiction})$$

**Therefore:**
$$A_{\text{mental}} \not\approx A_{\text{real}}$$

**This is why a ≠ a in TI framework!**

### 4.3 Examples of Relative Truth

**Example 1: Anti-Vax Ideology**
- **Existence:** -2.0 (vaccines demonstrably work, autism link refuted)
- **Morality:** -1.5 (harms public health)
- **Conscious Meaning:** 1.0 (meaningful to believers subjectively)
- **Aesthetics:** -0.5 (conspiracy theories often inelegant)
- **MR composite:** 0.4(-2.0) + 0.25(-1.5) + 0.25(1.0) + 0.1(-0.5) = -0.88
- **Influence:** Millions of believers, political movements
- **Result:** Relative Truth ✓ (Tralse-False, but influential!)

**Example 2: Flat Earth**
- **Existence:** -2.5 (Earth demonstrably spherical)
- **Morality:** 0.0 (neutral ethically)
- **Conscious Meaning:** 0.8 (meaningful to believers)
- **Aesthetics:** -1.0 (contradicts elegant cosmology)
- **MR composite:** 0.4(-2.5) + 0.25(0.0) + 0.25(0.8) + 0.1(-1.0) = -0.9
- **Influence:** Thousands of adherents, media presence
- **Result:** Relative Truth ✓

**Example 3: "I'm worthless" (Depression)**
- **Existence:** -1.8 (demonstrably false - person has value)
- **Morality:** -1.0 (harmful belief)
- **Conscious Meaning:** 1.5 (deeply meaningful to depressed person)
- **Aesthetics:** -1.2 (disharmonious self-view)
- **MR composite:** 0.4(-1.8) + 0.25(-1.0) + 0.25(1.5) + 0.1(-1.2) = -0.72
- **Influence:** Controls person's behavior
- **Result:** Relative Truth ✓ (true in imagination, false in reality)

### 4.4 The Power of Imagination

**Imagination's Role:**
- Creates novel combinations (creativity!)
- Generates hypotheticals (planning!)
- But also generates falsehoods (tralseness!)

**Two Types of Imagination:**

**1. GILE-Aligned Imagination (Good):**
- Scientific hypotheses
- Artistic creation
- Compassionate perspective-taking
- Future planning

**2. GILE-Misaligned Imagination (Creates Relative Truths):**
- Conspiracy theories
- Harmful stereotypes
- Depressive cognitions
- Narcissistic fantasies

**The Difference:** GILE-aligned imagination respects reality (Existence dimension), GILE-misaligned ignores it!

## 5. TRUTH CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHM

### 5.1 Step-by-Step Process

**Input:** A statement or belief

**Step 1: Score each dimension (-3 to 2)**
- Existence: How well does it match measurable reality?
- Morality: How GILE-aligned is it?
- Conscious Meaning: How meaningful subjectively?
- Aesthetics: How beautiful/harmonious?

**Step 2: Calculate composite MR**
$$\text{MR}_{\text{composite}} = 0.4G + 0.25I + 0.25L + 0.1E$$

**Step 3: Determine Tralse-True vs Tralse-False**
- If MR > 0 → Tralse-True
- If MR ≤ 0 → Tralse-False

**Step 4: Check for Absolute Truth**
- If ALL four dimensions ≥ 2.0 → **Absolute Truth**
- (This is case-by-case, requires careful analysis)

**Step 5: Check for Relative Truth**
- If Tralse-False AND held by influential group → **Relative Truth**

**Step 6: Otherwise**
- If Tralse-True → **Objective Truth**
- If Tralse-False but not influential → **Error/Delusion** (not "truth" at all)

### 5.2 Decision Tree

```
Statement/Belief
    ↓
Calculate MR across 4 dimensions
    ↓
All dimensions ≥ 2.0?
    ├─ YES → ABSOLUTE TRUTH
    └─ NO → Continue
        ↓
    MR_composite > 0?
        ├─ YES → OBJECTIVE TRUTH (Tralse-True)
        └─ NO → Continue
            ↓
        Held by influential group?
            ├─ YES → RELATIVE TRUTH (Tralse-False but influential)
            └─ NO → Error/Delusion (not truth)
```

## 6. IMPLICATIONS

### 6.1 Resolving Hard Problem of Consciousness

**Traditional:** Qualia is subjective, unmeasurable, ontologically special

**TI-UOP:** Qualia is Objective Truth, measurable via 4-dimensional MR!

**Result:** Hard problem SOLVED! Qualia isn't special category - it's just reality with high Conscious Meaning dimension.

### 6.2 Unifying Ethics and Epistemology

**Traditional:** "Ought" vs "is" (Hume's guillotine)

**TI-UOP:** Morality is dimension 2 of truth! Ethics IS epistemology!

**Result:** You can derive "ought" from "is" by measuring GILE alignment!

### 6.3 Handling Relativism

**Traditional Relativism:** "All truths are relative to culture/person"

**TI-UOP:** Only Relative Truths are relative! Objective and Absolute truths are NOT.

**Result:** Healthy pluralism (respect cultural differences in Relative Truths) while maintaining universal standards (Absolute Truths exist!)

### 6.4 Depression Treatment

**Depressive Cognitions = Relative Truths!**

"I'm worthless" → Tralse-False, but true in imagination

**Treatment:**
1. Measure MR across 4 dimensions (show it's <0)
2. Identify which dimension is most false (usually Existence)
3. Provide evidence correcting that dimension
4. Shift from Relative Truth → Objective Truth

**Example:**
- "I'm worthless" → Existence = -1.8
- Evidence: You have friends who care, skills, accomplishments
- New MR: Existence = 0.8
- Result: Belief shifts to Objective Truth ("I have value")

## 7. APPLICATIONS

### 7.1 Science

**Scientific Theories = Objective Truths (when validated)**

Criteria:
- High Existence dimension (matches measurements)
- Neutral Morality (descriptive, not prescriptive)
- High Aesthetics (elegant, simple)
- Meaning varies by subjective impact

**Laws of Physics → Approaching Absolute Truth**
(E=mc², conservation laws, etc. have very high MR across all dimensions!)

### 7.2 Religion

**Religious Claims = Spectrum from Absolute → Relative**

**Absolute Truths:**
- "Love is good"
- "Compassion reduces suffering"
- "Unity consciousness exists"

**Objective Truths:**
- "Prayer changes brain states" (measurable!)
- "Meditation improves wellbeing"
- "Community provides meaning"

**Relative Truths:**
- Specific doctrines contradicting evidence
- Harmful dogmas (slavery justified, etc.)
- Supernatural claims without measurable effects

**Result:** Keep the GILE-aligned core, discard Relative Truths!

### 7.3 Politics

**Political Ideologies = Mix of Objective and Relative Truths**

**Objective:**
- "Poverty causes suffering" (measurable)
- "Democracy allows participation"
- "Education improves outcomes"

**Relative:**
- "My party is always right" (tribalism)
- "Other side is evil" (dehumanization)
- "Simple solutions work" (ignoring complexity)

**Result:** Evaluate policies via 4-dimensional MR, not tribal affiliation!

## 8. FUTURE WORK

### 8.1 Qualia Measurement Protocols

Develop standardized methods for measuring subjective experience objectively:
- EEG signatures for specific qualia
- HEM state characterization
- Biophoton emission correlates
- Behavioral/neural convergence

### 8.2 Moral Calculus

Formalize ethics using MR framework:
- Trolley problems via 4D MR
- Utilitarian vs deontological via dimension weights
- Virtue ethics via GILE alignment

### 8.3 Truth Databases

Create searchable databases:
- Common beliefs → MR scores
- Scientific theories → classification
- Religious claims → truth type
- Political statements → objective analysis

---

## 9. CONCLUSION

The three types of truth (Absolute, Objective, Relative) provide rigorous framework for:

1. **Resolving qualia's status** - It's Objective, not special!
2. **Unifying ethics and epistemology** - Morality is dimension of truth
3. **Handling relativism** - Acknowledge Relative Truths while maintaining universal standards
4. **Treating depression** - Shift beliefs from Relative → Objective
5. **Evaluating claims** - 4-dimensional MR provides quantitative measure

**Key Insights:**

✅ **Qualia CAN be objectively measured** (via MR across 4 dimensions)  
✅ **Imagination creates tralseness** (mental model ≠ reality)  
✅ **Free will requires CCC's <100% perfection** (0.3% variance allows choice)  
✅ **All truth types are measurable** (even Relative Truths via influence metrics)

**The paradigm shift:**
- Old: Subjective vs objective (unbridgeable gap)
- New: All truth has 4 objective dimensions, some more aligned with GILE than others

**"Truth is not relative—but some truths are Relative Truths."**
