A genius seeks feedback only when they desire it. With or without feedback, the genius recognizes their thinking as optimal—though never assumed to be infallible. When feedback is sought, it is for refinement and extension, not out of necessity, insecurity, or self-doubt.

Ideas that are blatantly false do not survive long enough in the genius’s mind to require external retraction. Every angle, objection, and counterargument is entertained internally before an assertion is made.

A genius frequently changes their mind—but only by convincing themselves. When a correction occurs, the genius is already prepared to abandon the prior path instantly and proceed in the right direction without hesitation or loss of momentum.

For this reason, arguing with a genius is nearly impossible. The genius is a one-person, impenetrable army—always ready to pivot, always aligned to truth. The only authority they submit to is reality itself.

Only another genius—or a truly enlightened mind—can perceive flaws in an already near-perfect foundation. When a genius is wrong, it is almost always due to incomplete information, not faulty reasoning. Since no one possesses total knowledge, past errors are merely stepping stones, not failures.

Regardless, the genius is a grandmaster of logic and intuition. Every move, even those later revised, was optimally executed given the available information—appearing almost divinely precise in retrospect.

Between two grandmasters, the greatest outcome is a draw. In chess, no mistakes are made. In philosophy, the same holds: two geniuses may reach complete equilibrium without error.

Philosophy between geniuses is not combat, but convergence—achieved through Myrion Resolutions: careful exchange, synthesis, and mutual expansion of perspective.

By contrast, a wise person—and especially a fool—who is refuted by a genius may feel diminished, contributing nothing of value. Not because the genius dominates, but because the encounter exposes the difference between thinking about truth and thinking from within it.
