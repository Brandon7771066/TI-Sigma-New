Axiom 1 — Ontic Primacy

Truth exists independently of minds as the time-indexed tralse state of beings or systems.

Truth begins with the thing itself.

⸻

Axiom 2 — Representational Fallibility

All representations of truth are imperfect and contain simultaneous degrees of truth and falsity (tralse).

No depiction is purely true or purely false.

⸻

Axiom 3 — Accuracy Distinction

Accuracy is the degree to which a representation correctly matches the ontic truth of a being or system.
	•	Accuracy is mind-independent
	•	Accuracy exists whether or not it is known

⸻

Axiom 4 — Certainty Distinction

Certainty is the degree to which a subject has resolved a representation via Myrion Resolution (MR) at a given time.
	•	Certainty is subject-relative
	•	Certainty ≠ accuracy
	•	Uncertainty = unresolved information, not error

⸻

Axiom 5 — Myrion Resolution (MR)

Truth is approached through iterative resolution under constraints.
	•	MR completion ∈ [0,1]
	•	Uncertainty = 1 − MR
	•	Higher MR = greater justified certainty at that stage

⸻

Axiom 6 — Ternary MR Outputs

Each MR stage yields three independent PD-graded values:
	1.	Accuracy — how right the representation is
	2.	Certainty — how resolved it is for the subject
	3.	Truth Value — tralse synthesis across dimensions

⸻

Axiom 7 — Four-Dimensional Truth

Truth Value integrates four irreducible dimensions:
	•	Ontic fit (what exists)
	•	Ethical impact (what it does)
	•	Conscious meaning (how it is experienced)
	•	Structural / aesthetic harmony (how coherently it integrates)

⸻

Axiom 8 — Ethical Weighting Is Intrinsic

All belief formation and inquiry is already morally weighted.

Pragmatism is not optional — it is embedded in truth via ethical relevance.

⸻

Axiom 9 — Information Requires Recognition

Truth alone is not information.
	•	Information = truth + recognition
	•	Therefore, some form of awareness must be omnipresent

Before minds, there must have been proto-recognition.

⸻

Axiom 10 — Perspective Incompleteness

Third-person truth is necessarily incomplete without first-person qualia.
	•	Simulation improves approximation
	•	Real-time completeness requires shared first-person access

⸻

Axiom 11 — Asymmetry of Certainty

False certainty is more harmful than unresolved uncertainty.
	•	PD weighting penalizes overconfidence
	•	Uncertainty is tolerated unless it blocks coherence or ethical action

⸻

Axiom 12 — Potential Knowability

All truths are in principle knowable, but never perfectly knowable by any single subject at a time.

Deviation from total depiction is inevitable.
