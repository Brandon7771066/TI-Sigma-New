Yep — this is a known class of Replit behavior, and it’s usually not that your work vanished, it’s that the Agent/Assistant chat history UI (and sometimes checkpoint history) fails to show older sessions, especially across product updates, new chats, workspace changes, or backend hiccups. People have reported the “clock/history” panel going blank or only showing recent chats, even when they know older ones exist.  ￼

What’s likely going on (in plain English)

There are two different “histories” people confuse:
	1.	Your actual code history

	•	Git commits, file history, and snapshots/checkpoints (when enabled) are ways to get code back. Replit documents “Checkpoints and Rollbacks,” which let you restore to prior states.  ￼
	•	Even if chat history glitches, code changes often still exist in Git/file history.

	2.	The Replit Agent chat history (the conversation log)

	•	This is a separate UI layer. It can be incomplete, can bug out, and may not reliably provide a long-term, fully searchable archive. There are community threads asking for export and reporting missing/blank history.  ￼
	•	There are also reports of the agent chat history intermittently disappearing or not reflecting recent sessions.  ￼

So when you say “Replit didn’t get any conversations since 11/30/25,” the most probable explanation is:
	•	The chat log panel isn’t showing/retaining them, or it’s bugged, even if code changes happened.

What are our options to recover “all that content”?

Option 1: Treat GitLab as the source of truth for code (best for “everything we built”)

If your GitLab push contains the full repo state, that’s the big win. From there, we can reconstruct almost everything by:
	•	repo tree + module mapping
	•	commit timeline (if commits were made)
	•	diffs that show what changed and when

If you used Replit Agent heavily, it may have created a trail of changes that are visible as commits or file modifications. There are community suggestions to use the Git view/history to locate and restore prior states.  ￼

What this gets you: the actual TI project, which matters most.

What it might not get you: the chat transcripts (the “why” and “planning language”).

⸻

Option 2: Recover code states via Replit Checkpoints / File History (if available)

Even when chat history is missing, file history can still contain prior versions, and Replit describes restoring previous versions from File History.  ￼
If your workspace had Agent checkpoints enabled, rollbacks should exist—though users have reported the checkpoint/history UI going blank after updates.  ￼

What this gets you: earlier code states even if Git is messy.

⸻

Option 3: Recover the conversation content (harder)

Here are the realistic paths:

A) If those “conversations” were actually in ChatGPT (not Replit)
Then they won’t be inside Replit at all. Your best recovery is exporting/collecting from ChatGPT history.

B) If they were Replit Agent chats
Replit does not currently advertise an easy “export all chat transcripts” feature; users explicitly ask for it as a feature request.  ￼
So your best options are:
	•	Manual copy if they show anywhere in UI (sometimes older chats appear after reload / different browser / clearing cache).
	•	Replit Support ticket if the UI shows a gap and you need the logs restored server-side (especially since “history is gone/blank” has been treated as a bug class before).  ￼

C) If the chat history was only locally cached in the browser
Some tools store AI chat locally (e.g., IndexedDB/local storage). I can’t confirm Replit does this universally, but if it does in your case, switching browsers/devices could “lose” it. (This is why testing the same account on the same machine/browser sometimes “brings it back.”)

⸻

What I recommend you do right now (max recovery, minimal effort)
	1.	Finish the GitLab push ✅ (you’re already doing the most important part)
	2.	In Replit, open:
	•	Version control / Git history (see if the agent-generated changes are there)  ￼
	•	File History for key files (main entrypoint + core TI modules)  ￼
	•	Checkpoints/Rollbacks (if enabled)  ￼
	3.	If chat history panel is blank or stops at 11/30/25:
	•	try hard refresh, different browser, incognito, and same account
	•	if still missing: open a Replit support/community bug report citing the “history panel blank / missing older chats” issue (it’s a known pattern).  ￼
