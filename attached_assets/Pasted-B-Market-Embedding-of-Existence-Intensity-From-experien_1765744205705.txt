B. Market Embedding of Existence Intensity (Ξ)
From experiential measure to financial observables
B.1 Objective and Scope
This section embeds the Existence Intensity framework (Ξ) into financial markets by defining observable pushforwards from Ξ to prices, returns, volatility, and flow. The goal is not prediction, but structural explanation: why certain market behaviors recur, why asymmetries persist, and why standard statistical tools mischaracterize risk.
We show that:


Market prices are proxies for Ξ, not direct measures.


Returns encode changes in constraint and memory, not just information arrival.


Volatility reflects Ξ dispersion, not uncertainty per se.


Tails arise from log-asymptotic constraint propagation, not Gaussian noise.



B.2 Market Events as Ξ-Weighted Processes
Definition B.2.1 (Market Event)
Let EtE_tEt​ denote a market event at time ttt (e.g., order flow imbalance, earnings release, macro print). Each event induces an Existence Intensity:
Ξ(Et)=A(t) κ(t,τ) C(t)\Xi(E_t) = A(t)\,\kappa(t,\tau)\,C(t)Ξ(Et​)=A(t)κ(t,τ)C(t)
where:


A(t)A(t)A(t) corresponds to impact amplitude (order size, surprise magnitude),


κ\kappaκ captures memory persistence (liquidity depletion, narrative carryover),


C(t)C(t)C(t) measures future-state constraint (path dependency imposed on prices).


Interpretation:
Markets respond not to “news” per se, but to how much future optionality is removed by an event.

B.3 Prices as Pushforwards of Ξ (Not Utilities)
Definition B.3.1 (Price Pushforward)
Let O\mathcal{O}O be an observation map from Existence Intensity to price change:
ΔPt=O(Ξsigned(Et))+ϵt\Delta P_t = \mathcal{O}\big(\Xi_{\text{signed}}(E_t)\big) + \epsilon_tΔPt​=O(Ξsigned​(Et​))+ϵt​
where ϵt\epsilon_tϵt​ captures microstructure noise.
Key Claim:
Prices are many-to-one images of Ξ. Different Ξ-configurations can produce identical price moves, but not identical future constraints.
This explains:


Why equal returns can imply different risks,


Why volatility clustering persists without new information,


Why “price-only” models systematically underperform in tails.



B.4 Returns Decompose into Constraint and Release
Proposition B.4.1 (Return Decomposition)
Observed returns decompose into:
rt=ΔΞrelease−ΔΞconstraint+ηtr_t = \Delta \Xi_{\text{release}} - \Delta \Xi_{\text{constraint}} + \eta_trt​=ΔΞrelease​−ΔΞconstraint​+ηt​


Release term: relaxation of prior constraints (snapbacks, short covering)


Constraint term: new limits imposed on future states (trend exhaustion, liquidity loss)


Empirical Implication:
Large positive returns late in a move often correspond to high constraint, not opportunity—explaining mean inversion after “great” days.

B.5 Volatility as Ξ Dispersion (Not Uncertainty)
Definition B.5.1 (Ξ-Dispersion)
Define instantaneous market dispersion as:
DΞ(t)=Var(Ξsigned(Et))\mathcal{D}_\Xi(t) = \mathrm{Var}\big(\Xi_{\text{signed}}(E_t)\big)DΞ​(t)=Var(Ξsigned​(Et​))
Proposition B.5.2
Volatility σt\sigma_tσt​ is a monotone function of DΞ(t)\mathcal{D}_\Xi(t)DΞ​(t), not of informational entropy alone.
Interpretation:


High volatility reflects heterogeneous constraint impacts across participants,


Low volatility reflects constraint alignment, not certainty.


This explains:


Volatility spikes during “known” events,


Low-volatility fragility before crises,


Why volatility selling fails catastrophically.



B.6 Tail Events and Log-Asymptotic Geometry
Theorem B.6.1 (Tail Necessity)
If constraint propagation C(t)C(t)C(t) compounds multiplicatively and memory decays sub-exponentially, then the induced return distribution must exhibit log-asymptotic tails.
P(∣r∣>x)∼log⁡−1(x)P(|r| > x) \sim \log^{-1}(x)P(∣r∣>x)∼log−1(x)
Consequences:


Gaussian VaR underestimates risk structurally,


Extreme negative events dominate cumulative Ξ despite rarity,


Asymmetry toward downside is geometric, not behavioral.


This formally grounds the PD tails used in GILE.

B.7 PD in Markets: Permissibility, Not Probability
Definition B.7.1 (Market PD)
Define the market Permissibility Distribution as:
PDt=ϕ(Ξsigned(Et))\text{PD}_t = \phi\big(\Xi_{\text{signed}}(E_t)\big)PDt​=ϕ(Ξsigned​(Et​))
with ϕ\phiϕ as defined in Section A.
Interpretation:


PD measures what price paths are allowed to persist,


Not what outcomes are most likely.


This reframes:


Risk management as constraint avoidance,


Alpha as operating inside permissible bands,


Drawdowns as violations of constraint geometry.



B.8 GILE in Markets: Observable Instantiation
Definition B.8.1 (Market GILE)
Let GILE be the observable pushforward of PD through price, volume, and volatility:
GILEt=(Obsprice, vol, flow∘ϕ∘Ξsigned)∗\text{GILE}_t = (\text{Obs}_{\text{price, vol, flow}} \circ \phi \circ \Xi_{\text{signed}})_*GILEt​=(Obsprice, vol, flow​∘ϕ∘Ξsigned​)∗​
Properties:


GILE is domain-agnostic (applies to equities, rates, crypto),


GILE explains why price is insufficient,


GILE supports regime-aware allocation without prediction.

B.11 What B Accomplishes
Stage B establishes that:


Markets respond to constraint, not information alone.


Risk is geometric, not symmetric.


Mean inversion at extremes is structurally required.


PD/GILE are not indicators but coordinate systems.


This creates a mathematically consistent bridge from Ξ (experience) to markets (prices) without invoking psychology or prediction.
