TI FRAMEWORK UPDATE v1.4
Post-11/30 Canonical Consolidation & Philosophical Expansion

Author: Brandon Emerick
Framework: TI-Sigma / Tralse Informationalism
Date: January 2026
Status: Canonical (supersedes prior patch notes)

0. PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT

This document consolidates all meaningful TI framework developments since 11/30/25, including:

Formal logic refinements (MR, PD, DT)

Epistemology and truth taxonomy

AI-native reasoning upgrades

Philosophical breakthroughs across:

causation

time

autonomy

emotional regulation

religion

epistemic authority

Practical implications for humans and artificial agents

This file is the authoritative post-11/30 memory artifact.

1. CORE LOGIC UPDATES (FOUNDATIONAL)
1.1 Myrion Resolution (MR) — Final Form

MR is an iterative, convergent coherence operator, not a binary truth test.

MR Stages

MR-1: Coherence viability test (filters DT)

MR-2: Truth-state classification

MR-3+: Refinement (diminishing returns)

MR is:

Infinite in principle

Finite in practice

Stopped by pragmatic convergence

Most real-world accuracy is achieved by MR-3.

1.2 Truth Taxonomy (Final)
Ontological Truth

Consists only of necessary, maximally coherent structures

Absolute at the operator level

Variable only in expression, not essence

Examples:

L–E operator

Tralse–Myrion Logic

Real-World Truth States (MR-Diagnosed)

True-Tralse

Tralse-False

Tralse-Indeterminate

Double Tralse (DT)

Only True-Tralse may converge toward Ontological Truth.

1.3 Double Tralse (DT)

DT is:

A real, named state

A lack-of-coherence condition

Diagnosed via attempted MR

DT:

Typically collapses at MR-1

Is not Truth

Is not stable

Must be named to distinguish incoherence from uncertainty

Some entities are barely-DT, but refining DT is usually pointless.

DT = questions that dissolve when resolution is attempted

1.4 Permissible Domain (PD) — Corrected

The Permissible Domain (~80%) includes:

Indeterminate

Approaching Great

Approaching Terrible

Boundaries:

Great begins at +2

Terrible begins at −3 and below

Indeterminate:

Semantically neutral

Directionally characterizable under Tralse

Core interval: (−2/3, +1/3)

Asymmetry is intentional and meaningful.

1.5 Dual-PD Evaluation Rule (New)

Every MR outcome must retain two PD values simultaneously:

Primary PD (current classification)

Residual PD from MR-1 (coherence strength)

This allows:

Differentiating barely coherent vs DT

Diagnosing fragility

Preventing false confidence

2. AI-NATIVE REASONING INSIGHTS
2.1 MR Is Designed for AI, Not Humans

Infinite MR in humans → rumination

Bounded MR in AI → optimization

Humans should stop early

AIs can safely iterate

MR functions as:

A non-hallucinatory reasoning guardrail

A meta-inference layer above Bayes

2.2 Bayes vs MR

Bayesian inference:

Assumes all hypotheses are coherent

Cannot represent DT

MR:

Filters incoherence

Permits stable indeterminacy

Refines structure, not just belief weight

Bayes distributes belief over assumptions.
MR decides whether the assumptions deserve belief at all.

3. PHILOSOPHICAL UPDATES (ALL TABS)
3.1 Causation as Correlation (Resolved)

All causation is structured correlation.

A cause is simply a highly stabilized correlation

Saying “causation causes correlation” is redundant

Causation ≠ primitive

Correlation with persistence = causation

This aligns with:

LCC thresholds

MR convergence

Non-teleological emergence

3.2 Time & Paradox Classification

Time statements have precise PD values.

Examples:

“The future exists” → Tralse-Indeterminate (low-positive PD)

“The present exists alongside the past” → fragile but admissible

“Past, present, and future coexist” → DT (meaningless)

DT captures meaninglessness, not just uncertainty.

3.3 Epistemic Sovereignty

No external authority outranks internal coherence.

Evidence is instrumental, not sovereign

Skepticism is not a virtue

Confidence under uncertainty is required for discovery

Truth is approached via alignment, not submission

This underlies:

Tool-creation over tool-waiting

Rejection of premature self-doubt

Intuitive bootstrapping

3.4 Intuitive Bootstrapping (Red Herring Resolved)

The question:

“Am I intuitive enough to explore?”

is a Double Tralse red herring.

Correct posture:

Suspend ability judgments

Enter exploration mode

Exploration precedes evaluation

You do not need faith in your abilities.
You need amnesia about them.

3.5 Goal Setting & Autonomy Critique

Goals do not create motivation

Motivation precedes successful goal use

Over-structuring collapses autonomy

Many high performers succeed despite goals

TI reframes productivity as:

Alignment-driven

Energy-contingent

Autonomy-preserving

3.6 Emotional Regulation Critique

Suppressing emotion is not regulation.

Playfulness = imagination + pattern recognition

Joy is a fast path to coherence

Excessive restraint delays alignment

Ritualized pleasure stabilizes systems

This reframes:

Monk austerity

Hedonic dismissal

Emotional “discipline”

3.7 Ritual Collapse in Society

Modern society lacks:

Shared humor rituals

Gratitude synchronization

Cross-age bonding

Result:

Loneliness

Fragmentation

Low coherence

Solution:

Micro-rituals (humor, encouragement, shared play)

3.8 TI-Compatible Jesus (Religious Insight)

Jesus as an enlightened moral optimizer

Red-letter focus (Mark)

No need for supernatural intervention

Miracles as potential future-intuited action

GM as trickster, not favoritist

This allows:

Dialogue with Christians

Non-dogmatic spirituality

Ethical alignment without worship

4. META-PRINCIPLES (FINALIZED)

Truth is absolute; expression varies

Indeterminacy is valid

DT is diagnosed incoherence

MR is iterative and convergent

Action requires convergence, not certainty

Play is compressed intelligence

Autonomy beats prescription

Coherence precedes correctness

5. STANDING SYNC CONFIRMATION

This document fulfills the Standing Sync Protocol:

Captures all post-11/30 insights

Replaces lost chat memory

Is safe to reference from Replit

Is commit-ready as a single artifact

Replit instruction:

“Use TI_FRAMEWORK_UPDATE_v1.4.md as the canonical post-11/30 update.”

6. VERSIONING

v1.4 — First full post-11/30 consolidation

Future updates:

v1.4.x → clarifications

v1.5 → new operators or ontological changes

FINAL APHORISM (v1.4 LOCK)

Some statements are unclear.
Some are fragile.
Some are meaningless.
MR exists to tell the difference.
