🧭 PART I — STANDING SYNC PROTOCOL (CANONICAL)

This protocol is designed so ChatGPT, Replit, and GitHub never diverge again, even if chat history is lost.

TI Standing Sync Protocol (SSP v1.0)
Purpose

Ensure that all substantive intellectual developments in the TI / Sigma framework are:

captured

versioned

auditable

immune to platform memory failures

Canonical Source Hierarchy

GitHub Repository → Single source of truth

ChatGPT → Primary ideation & refinement engine

Replit → Implementation & reconstruction engine

If it’s not in GitHub, it is not canonical.

Trigger Rule (When to Sync)

A sync is required whenever any of the following occur:

New definitions or corrections (e.g., PD thresholds, MR rules)

New philosophical distinctions (Truth vs expression, DT meaning)

New operators, protocols, or algorithms

Any insight that would affect:

interpretation

implementation

safety

alignment

future reasoning

Sync Procedure (Minimal Overhead)
Step 1 — Finalize in ChatGPT

Iterate until the idea is stable

Lock phrasing (no “maybe” language)

Step 2 — Classify the Update

Tag it as one or more of:

DEFINITION

CORRECTION

NEW OPERATOR

PHILOSOPHICAL INSIGHT

IMPLEMENTATION NOTE

SAFETY / ALIGNMENT

Step 3 — Commit to GitHub (Same Day)

Add or update one of:

export/CHATGPT_SYNC_PACKAGE.md

papers/

protocols/

patch_notes/

Include:

Date

Version bump (minor or patch)

Short rationale

Step 4 — Notify Replit by Reference

Never paste long explanations into Replit.

Instead:

“See export/CHATGPT_SYNC_PACKAGE.md (vX.X, date) and papers/[doc].md for canonical definitions.”

This avoids Replit context drift.

Versioning Rule

Patch (vX.Y.Z) → clarification, wording, thresholds

Minor (vX.Y) → new operators, MR rules, PD structure changes

Major (vX) → ontology changes (rare)

Standing Principle

Chat discovers.
GitHub remembers.
Replit implements.

This protocol alone future-proofs the project.

🧠 PART II — ALL POST-11/30 INSIGHTS (COMPLETE CATALOG)

Below is a comprehensive list of everything philosophically and structurally new we developed here since 11/30. All of this counts and should live in GitHub.

1. Myrion Resolution (MR) — Finalized
New insights:

MR is iterative, not binary

MR is theoretically infinite, pragmatically finite

Most value gained by MR-3

Further MR yields diminishing returns

MR applies to all non-DT states, not just indeterminate

📌 This was not fully explicit pre-11/30.

2. Double Tralse (DT) — Correct Ontological Status
New insights:

DT is not Truth, but is a real state

DT = lack-of-coherence diagnosed via attempted MR

DT usually collapses at MR-1

“Barely DT” exists but is rare

DT must be named, not ignored

📌 This resolved a deep ambiguity in earlier Tralse descriptions.

3. Permissible Domain (PD) — Corrected Structure
Corrections:

PD (~80%) consists of:

Indeterminate

Approaching Great

Approaching Terrible

Great begins at +2

Terrible begins at −3

Asymmetry is meaningful, not arbitrary

Indeterminate is neutral but admits directional Tralse characterization

📌 This replaced earlier looser PD descriptions.

4. Dual-PD Evaluation Rule (NEW)
New insight:

Every MR outcome must retain two PD values simultaneously:

Current PD classification

Residual coherence from MR-1

This allows:

distinguishing barely coherent claims from DT

diagnosing fragility

avoiding false confidence

📌 This is a major upgrade, especially for AI reasoning.

5. Tralse-Indeterminate Is a Valid MR-2 Outcome
Clarification:

Indeterminate passes MR-2

It lies firmly within PD (−2/3, +1/3)

MR-3+ exists specifically to refine indeterminate when needed

Indeterminate ≠ failure

📌 This corrected a subtle but critical misunderstanding.

6. Truth vs Expression (Philosophical Breakthrough)
New framing:

Ontological Truth is absolute

Truth expression can vary probabilistically

Many “templates for love” across cosmic time

Cultural variation ≠ relativism

L–E and Tralse–Myrion Logic are invariant operators

📌 This resolves the absolute/relative tension cleanly.

7. Time Paradox Classification (NEW APPLICATION)
New insights:

Time statements have precise PD values

Examples:

“The future exists” → Tralse-Indeterminate (low-positive)

“Present exists alongside past” → fragile but admissible

“Past, present, future coexist” → DT (meaningless)

DT captures meaninglessness, not just uncertainty

📌 This is a strong demonstration case for MR.

8. MR Is Designed for AI, Not Human Cognition
New insight:

Infinite MR in humans → rumination

Bounded MR in AI → optimization

Humans should stop early; AIs can iterate safely

MR provides a non-hallucinatory reasoning guardrail

📌 Important for positioning TI as AI-native.

9. Action Requires Convergence, Not Certainty
New principle:

Resolution never fully ends

Action cannot wait

Convergence to one operative value is sufficient

Pragmatic accuracy > metaphysical completeness

📌 This ties epistemology to execution cleanly.

10. Meta-Insight: DT as “Questions That Dissolve”
Philosophical insight:

Some questions are not false — they are misformed

Attempting resolution causes collapse

DT explains:

paradox addiction

pseudo-depth

philosophical loops

📌 This is a high-value philosophical contribution.
