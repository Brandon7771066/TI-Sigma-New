# 🎩 PSI Magic Tricks & Practical Applications

**Which magic tricks are genuinely PSI-based, and how can they serve good purposes?**

---

## 🌟 **OVERVIEW**

**Key Distinction:**
- **Mathematical Magic:** Uses algorithms, counting, geometry (21-card trick)
- **PSI Magic:** Requires actual consciousness interface, intuition, quantum effects
- **Hybrid:** Both mathematical structure AND consciousness activation

**This document focuses on GENUINE PSI tricks with practical applications!**

## 🎯 **CATEGORY 1: PURE PSI TRICKS**

### **1. The Zener Card Test (Classic PSI Validation)**
