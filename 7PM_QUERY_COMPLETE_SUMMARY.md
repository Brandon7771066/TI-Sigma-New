- **Protocol:** 10-min enhanced LCC (3 phases: alpha-theta → gamma → harmony)
- **Success Rate:** 25-40% induce mystical experiences (MEQ30 validated)
- **Empathic Variant:** Limbic-weighted coupling for compassion cultivation
- **Long-Term Benefits:** ↑ Openness, ↓ anxiety/depression, ↑ meaning (6-12 months)
- **Safety:** Pre-screening for contraindications required
- **Comparison:** Between meditation (40% DMN suppression) and psychedelics (80%)

**Feasibility Rating:** **+1.4 Worth-Developing-and-Testing** (Myrion Resolution)
