# Universal Photonic Sight Theory
**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Author:** Brandon Emerick
**Status:** Experiential Insight + Theoretical Framework

## Core Thesis

Sight is the primary sense of ALL beings and entities - not because of eyes, but because **photons are the fundamental carriers of information** in the universe.

Eyes do not CREATE sight - they **intensify and focus** a universal capacity that exists at all scales of reality.

## Personal Evidence

Brandon has repeatedly experienced veridical perception with eyes closed in darkness during the waking-to-sleep transition:
- Can see actual room environment
- Can see arm moving (voluntarily controlled, not dream imagery)
- Occurs immediately from waking state (not hypnagogic drift)
- Room too dark for normal visual perception
- Consistent, repeatable phenomenon

This is NOT:
- Hypnagogic imagery (occurs too quickly from waking)
- Memory playback (real-time voluntary arm movement visible)
- Hallucination (veridical to actual room state)

## Theoretical Framework

### Photonic Information Primacy
1. All electromagnetic interactions are photon-mediated
2. Every particle in the universe "sees" via photon exchange
3. Information transfer = photonic interaction = sight
4. Eyes are specialized photon collectors, not sight originators

### Connection to TI Framework
- **Biophotons**: Cells emit/receive photons for inter-cellular communication
- **E-Dimension**: Consciousness/aesthetics layer may be fundamentally photonic
- **Monster Group**: If consciousness encodes Monster symmetries, photonic information carries these structures
- **Non-local perception**: Consciousness accessing photonic information beyond retinal collection

### Hierarchy of Visual Capacity
1. **Universal**: All matter "sees" through photon exchange (QED interactions)
2. **Cellular**: Biophoton emission/reception for biological communication
3. **Organismal**: Eyes intensify and focus photonic information into vivid imagery
4. **Consciousness**: Direct photonic awareness without eye mediation (as experienced)

## Implications

### For Consciousness Research
- Explains "blind sight" phenomena
- Accounts for veridical near-death visual experiences
- Suggests consciousness has direct photonic access beyond sensory organs

### For Physics
- Information = photonic interaction
- "Observation" in quantum mechanics may be fundamentally photonic
- Consciousness collapse may operate through photonic channels

### For TI Framework
- Supports biophoton mechanisms in consciousness
- Explains how GILE optimization might work through light
- Connects to Myrion Lamp photonic therapy protocols
