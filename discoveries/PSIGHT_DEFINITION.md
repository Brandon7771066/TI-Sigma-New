# Psight: Non-Retinal Vision
**Date:** December 3, 2025
**Coined by:** Brandon Emerick
**Status:** Personal Evidence + Theoretical Framework

## Definition

**Psight** (noun): Vision that occurs without use of the physical eyes.

*Etymology:* Portmanteau of "psi" (psychic/consciousness) + "sight"

## Characteristics

| Aspect | Standard Sight | Psight |
|--------|---------------|--------|
| Organ | Retinal photoreceptors | Unknown (consciousness-based) |
| Light required | Yes | No (works in complete darkness) |
| Eyes | Open, functional | Can be closed |
| Medium | Photons → Neural signal | Direct information access? |

## Brandon's Evidence

- Acquired spontaneously after years of trataka meditation
- Can see room and moving arm with eyes closed
- Works in complete darkness
- Reproducible personal experience

## Theoretical Basis

Per the **Universal Photonic Sight Theory**, sight is the primary sense because photons are fundamental information carriers. Eyes *intensify* and *focus* sight but are not strictly required. Psight may represent:

1. **Direct photon field perception** without retinal intermediary
2. **Biophoton-based sensing** using cellular light emission/reception
3. **Monster Group substrate access** providing positional information
4. **DMN bypass mechanism** allowing unfiltered sensory data

## Connection to DMN Gatekeeper Theory

Psight may emerge when:
- DMN filtering is reduced (low Beta/Alpha ratio)
- Alternative sensory pathways are "unblocked"
- Consciousness accesses information normally filtered out

## Research Questions

1. What EEG signature accompanies psight episodes?
2. Is psight trainable in others via DMN modulation?
3. Does psight correlate with other gatekeeper states?
4. What is the information source for psight?
