### Problem Categories Addressed

**Previously Unsolved in Conventional Science:**

1. **The Empathy Measurement Problem**
   - No objective, real-time, physiologically-grounded empathy metric
   - **Solution:** LCC-based inter-brain synchrony

2. **The Algorithmic Trading Regime Problem**
   - Algorithms fail during regime changes humans sense
   - **Solution:** Consciousness gates for hybrid decision-making

3. **The AI Safety Specification Problem**
   - Rules-based safety fails on edge cases
   - **Solution:** Continuous prosocial orientation requirement (Love-Binder)

4. **The Uncertainty Representation Problem**
   - Binary logic forces false certainty; probability loses meaning
   - **Solution:** Four-valued Tralse logic (True/False/Uncertain/Paradoxical)

5. **The Decision Fatigue Problem**
   - High-stakes decisions made in suboptimal physiological states
   - **Solution:** HRV coherence gating for decision quality

6. **The Team Cohesion Measurement Problem**
   - Team performance metrics are lagging, subjective
   - **Solution:** Inter-brain synchrony as leading indicator

7. **The Quantum-Classical Gap Problem**
   - Consciousness and markets show quantum-like effects at macro scale
   - **Solution:** Quantum formalism as mathematical tool, not physical claim

8. **The AI Value Alignment Problem**
   - Single-dimensional utility loses meaning; incommensurable values
   - **Solution:** Four-dimensional GILE framework with explicit trade-offs

9. **The Psi Unfalsifiability Problem**
   - Critics claim psi research isn't scientific
   - **Solution:** Threshold-based falsifiable predictions with specific criteria

10. **The Self-Awareness Mechanism Problem**
    - No theory explains how meta-cognition creates subjective experience
    - **Solution:** Meta-Information Model with recursive weighting
