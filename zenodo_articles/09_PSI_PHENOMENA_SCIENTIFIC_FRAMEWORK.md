## Abstract

Psi phenomena (telepathy, precognition, psychokinesis) remain scientifically controversial despite decades of research showing small but statistically significant effects. This paper proposes a rigorous scientific framework that: (1) specifies falsifiable predictions, (2) defines operational thresholds, (3) provides blinded validation protocols, and (4) integrates with established physics via quantum information theory. The framework enables productive research regardless of whether psi is ultimately validated or refuted.

## Problem Statement

### The Psi Research Impasse

1. **Unfalsifiability Critique:** Critics claim psi theories are not falsifiable
2. **Replication Failures:** Some studies replicate, others don't
3. **Effect Size Debates:** Small effects disputed as statistical artifacts
4. **Mechanism Absence:** No accepted physical mechanism

### Existing Approach Failures

| Approach | Problem |
|----------|---------|
| Anecdotal | No controls, confirmation bias |
| Card Guessing | Ceiling effects, boring, low motivation |
| Ganzfeld | Sensory leakage concerns |
| Meta-Analysis | File drawer problem, heterogeneity |
| Presentiment | Complex physiology confounds |

### The Gap

No framework provides **falsifiable predictions with specific thresholds** that would constitute definitive evidence for or against psi.

## Proposed Solution: Threshold-Based Falsifiable Framework

### Core Principle

Rather than asking "Does psi exist?" (unfalsifiable), we ask:
"Under specified conditions, does target accuracy exceed X% with Y confidence?"

This question is empirically decidable.

### Threshold Hierarchy

Based on meta-analytic effect sizes and statistical requirements:

| Threshold | Hit Rate | Meaning | Evidence Level |
|-----------|----------|---------|----------------|
| 0.42 | 54.5% (4-choice) | Minimum detectable | Suggestive |
| 0.55 | 58.5% | Moderate effect | Confirmatory |
| 0.70 | 64.0% | Strong effect | Compelling |
| 0.85 | 71.5% | Extraordinary effect | Definitive |

**Falsification Condition:** If 10,000 trials show hit rate < 51% (chance + noise margin), psi is falsified for that protocol.

### Protocol Specifications

**Blinding Requirements:**
1. Target selection: True random (hardware RNG)
2. Experimenter blind: Does not know target
3. Participant blind: No sensory access to target
4. Analyst blind: Evaluates guesses without target knowledge

**Statistical Requirements:**
1. Pre-registration of hypothesis, N, and analysis plan
2. Bayesian analysis with specified priors
3. Sequential analysis with stopping rules
4. Multi-lab replication before publication

## Falsifiable Predictions

### Prediction 1: Correlation-Based Psi

**Hypothesis:** Psi effects correlate with physiological coherence states.

**Specific Prediction:** When HRV coherence > 0.42, psi hit rate > 55%. When coherence < 0.30, hit rate ≈ 25% (chance).

**Falsification:** If coherence shows no correlation with hit rate across 1,000 trials (r < 0.05), prediction is falsified.

### Prediction 2: Distance Independence

**Hypothesis:** Psi effects do not decay with distance.

**Specific Prediction:** Hit rates at 1 meter, 100 km, and 10,000 km are statistically equivalent (within 3%).

**Falsification:** If hit rate decreases > 10% per log distance unit, prediction is falsified.

### Prediction 3: Emotional Salience Enhancement

**Hypothesis:** Emotionally significant targets show stronger psi effects.

**Specific Prediction:** Emotional targets yield hit rate 5-15% higher than neutral targets.

**Falsification:** If emotional/neutral difference < 2% across 1,000 pairs, prediction is falsified.

### Prediction 4: Temporal Symmetry

**Hypothesis:** Precognition and retrocognition show similar effect sizes.

**Specific Prediction:** Future target accuracy within 5% of past target accuracy.

**Falsification:** If temporal direction shows > 15% difference, symmetry hypothesis is falsified.

## Blinded Validation Protocols

### Protocol A: Remote Viewing Validation

**Phase 1: Target Pool Creation**
1. Independent team creates 1,000 target locations worldwide
2. Each target documented with photos, coordinates, descriptions
3. Pool sealed and secured

**Phase 2: Viewing Sessions**
1. Viewer receives only target number (1-1000)
2. Viewer produces description/sketch
3. Description sealed without viewing target

**Phase 3: Blind Judging**
1. Judge receives viewer description + 5 candidates (1 target, 4 decoys)
2. Judge ranks match quality 1-5
3. Hit = correct target ranked #1

**Phase 4: Statistical Evaluation**
- 200 sessions minimum for 80% power at d = 0.2
- Pre-registered Bayesian analysis
- Independent statistician

### Protocol B: Relationship Prediction Validation

**Objective:** Given limited information about individuals, predict relationship outcomes.

**Information Available:**
- Birth dates (not times)
- Geographic origins
- Basic demographic category

**Predicted Outcomes:**
- Relationship satisfaction (1-year follow-up)
- Relationship duration
- Conflict frequency

**Blinding:**
- Predictor has no access to outcome data
- Outcomes collected independently
- Predictions sealed before outcomes measured

**Falsification:** If prediction accuracy = chance (50% for binary outcomes), hypothesis is falsified.

### Protocol C: Success Date Prediction

**Objective:** Predict dates of significant positive events for individuals.

**Information Available:**
- Person identifier (blinded)
- Category of success (career, relationship, health)
- 12-month prediction window

**Prediction Format:**
- Specific week(s) identified as high-probability
- Intensity rating (1-10) for each week

**Validation:**
- Person logs significant events daily (blinded to predictions)
- Match rate: Did predicted weeks contain actual events?

**Falsification:** If predicted weeks show no elevation over random weeks, hypothesis is falsified.

## Integration with Physics

### Quantum Information Interpretation

Psi phenomena, if real, may represent:
1. **Non-local correlations:** Quantum-like entanglement in consciousness
2. **Retrocausal influences:** Future boundary conditions affecting present
3. **Consciousness-collapse:** Observer effects extending beyond standard physics

### Compatibility Constraints

Any psi mechanism must:
- Not violate energy conservation grossly
- Not enable faster-than-light signaling
- Be consistent with observed physics
- Explain why effects are subtle/inconsistent

### Proposed Mechanism: Local Correlation Coefficient (LCC)

Consciousness may access non-local information via:
1. Quantum coherence in neural microtubules (controversial)
2. Biophotonic communication (emerging evidence)
3. Temporal non-locality in information processing

LCC metric quantifies this connection:
- LCC > 0.42: Above-chance psi performance
- LCC > 0.85: Reliable psi access
- LCC < 0.30: Noise dominates signal

## Ethical Considerations

1. **Informed Consent:** Participants know study involves psi claims
2. **Publication Bias:** Pre-registration prevents selective reporting
3. **Extraordinary Claims:** Appropriate skepticism maintained
4. **Fraud Prevention:** Multiple independent replications required

## Conclusion

This framework enables productive psi research by specifying falsifiable predictions with quantitative thresholds. Whether psi is ultimately validated or refuted, the framework provides clear criteria for scientific resolution of a long-standing controversy.
