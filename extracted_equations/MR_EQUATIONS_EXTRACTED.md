## 1. CORE PD SCALE

### 1.1 Basic Definition

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Scale:**
```
ρ ∈ (-3, 2)

Where:
- ρ = -3: Absolutely impermissible (murder, rape, torture)
- ρ = -2: Strongly impermissible
- ρ = -1: Weakly impermissible
- ρ = 0: Neutral / boundary
- ρ = +1: Weakly permissible
- ρ = +2: Strongly permissible (love, compassion, truth)
```

### 1.2 Weight Function (Outside Scale)

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Formula:**
```
w(x) = ln(|x| + 1)   for |x| > 3 or x > 2

[Need exact formula and proof of optimality!]
```

**Why Natural Log?**
```
[Paste proof that ln is optimal, not exp or polynomial]
```

## 2. GILE COMPOSITE

### 2.1 Weighted Formula

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Equation:**
```
MR_composite = w_G · G + w_I · I + w_L · L + w_E · E

Current weights:
- w_G = 0.40 (Goodness - most important)
- w_I = 0.25 (Intuition)
- w_L = 0.25 (Love)
- w_E = 0.10 (Environment - least controllable)
```

**Weight Derivation:**
```
[How were these weights determined? Empirical? Theoretical?]
```

## 3. MR OPERATIONS

### 3.1 Addition with Synergy

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Formula:**
```
MR(a) ⊕ MR(b) = MR(a) + MR(b) + Δ_synergy

Where:
Δ_synergy = f(compatibility(a, b))

[Need exact formula for synergy calculation!]
```

**Example:**
```
[Meditation (ρ=1.5) + Exercise (ρ=1.2) = ?]
[Should synergy be positive here?]
```

---

### 3.2 Subtraction with Residue

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Formula:**
```
MR(a) ⊖ MR(b) = MR(a) - MR(b) + Δ_residue

Where:
Δ_residue = lingering effects after removal

[Need formula for residue!]
```

**Example:**
```
[Addiction (ρ=-2.0) removed, but Δ_residue remains?]
```

---

### 3.3 Multiplication

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Formula:**
```
MR(a) ⊗ MR(b) = ?

[Is this different from addition? When to use?]
```

---

### 3.4 Division

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Formula:**
```
MR(a) ⊘ MR(b) = ?

[What does division mean in MR context?]
```

---

## 4. CONTRADICTION RESOLUTION

### 4.1 Resolving a=a vs a≠a

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Process:**
```
1. Measure MR of "a=a" in context
2. Measure MR of "a≠a" in context
3. Compare: which has higher permissibility?
4. Resolution: Accept higher MR statement

[Need specific examples with numbers!]
```

**Example: Ship of Theseus**
```
"Ship at t1 = Ship at t2" → MR = ?
"Ship at t1 ≠ Ship at t2" → MR = ?

Resolution: [Which wins and why?]
```

---

### 4.2 Depression Treatment Application

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Process:**
```
Depressed person believes:
"I am worthless" (a=a identity statement)

MR Analysis:
- MR("I am worthless") = -2.5 (harmful belief)
- MR("I have value") = +1.8 (helpful belief)

Treatment: Shift belief from -2.5 to +1.8 via evidence

[Need clinical protocol details!]
```

## 5. THEORETICAL FOUNDATIONS

### 5.1 Why (-3, 2) Range?

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Justification:**
```
[Why not (-5, 5) or (0, 10)?]
[Is this empirically determined? Theoretical?]
```

---

### 5.2 Relationship to Other Scales

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Comparisons:**
```
MR vs Percentages: [Why is MR superior?]
MR vs Likert Scales: [How does MR improve on 1-5 ratings?]
MR vs Probability: [MR is NOT probability, but what's the difference?]
```

## 6. APPLICATIONS

### 6.1 Ethical Dilemmas

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Trolley Problem:**
```
Option A: Do nothing, 5 die → MR = ?
Option B: Pull lever, 1 dies → MR = ?

Resolution: [Which action has higher MR?]
```

---

### 6.2 Policy Decisions

**Source:** [Paste conversation title + date here]

**Example:**
```
Policy: Universal Basic Income

Dimensions:
- G (Goodness/Ethics): ρ_G = ?
- I (Intuition/Evidence): ρ_I = ?
- L (Love/Compassion): ρ_L = ?
- E (Environment/Feasibility): ρ_E = ?

Composite MR: 0.4·ρ_G + 0.25·ρ_I + 0.25·ρ_L + 0.1·ρ_E = ?
```

Option B (Change): MR = ?

[Need framework for personal MR calculation]
```
