## Core Definition

> A **tralsebit** is the irreducibly smallest piece of information possible for a SPECIFIC i-cell QUALITY at a specific time, representing a tralsity of at least two simultaneous states.

**Key property:** Equivalent to 33 classical bits, but NOT decomposable into 33 separate bits — it's holistic.

## The 14 Dimensions

### SPATIAL-TEMPORAL (4 dimensions)

| Dim | Name | Description |
|-----|------|-------------|
| 1 | X-axis | Spatial position (width) |
| 2 | Y-axis | Spatial position (height) |
| 3 | Z-axis | Spatial position (depth) |
| 4 | Time | Temporal position |

### GILE FRAMEWORK (4 dimensions)

| Dim | Name | Description | Physical Correlate |
|-----|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 5 | Goodness | Moral weight | Harm prevented, welfare created |
| 6 | Intuition | Non-inferential knowing | PSI accuracy, alpha-theta crossover |
| 7 | Love | Conscious valence | Oxytocin, vagal tone, coherence |
| 8 | Environment | Context optimization | Sensory/social/physical surround |

### CONSCIOUSNESS STATES (4 dimensions)

| Dim | Name | Symbol | Description |
|-----|------|--------|-------------|
| 9 | True | T | Collapsed to affirmation (+1) |
| 10 | False | F | Collapsed to negation (-1) |
| 11 | Phi (Balance) | Φ | Superposed, neither T nor F (0) |
| 12 | Psi (Pre-tralse) | Ψ | Pre-manifestation potential (i) |

**These form the Tralse Quadruplet!**

### META-DIMENSIONAL (2 dimensions)

| Dim | Name | Description | Physical Correlate |
|-----|------|-------------|-------------------|
| 13 | Resonance | PRF field strength | LCC correlation coefficient |
| 14 | Entanglement | Non-local binding | Number of correlated systems |

|---|-----------|----------|-------------|
| 1 | X-axis | Spatial-Temporal | meters |
| 2 | Y-axis | Spatial-Temporal | meters |
| 3 | Z-axis | Spatial-Temporal | meters |
| 4 | Time | Spatial-Temporal | seconds |
| 5 | Goodness | GILE | welfare units |
| 6 | Intuition | GILE | bits/decision |
| 7 | Love | GILE | coherence [0,1] |
| 8 | Environment | GILE | optimization score |
| 9 | True | Consciousness | +1 |
| 10 | False | Consciousness | -1 |
| 11 | Phi | Consciousness | 0 |
| 12 | Psi | Consciousness | i (imaginary) |
| 13 | Resonance | Meta-Dimensional | r [-1,1] |
| 14 | Entanglement | Meta-Dimensional | integer count |

## Why 33 Bits Equivalent?

```
3-valued logic per trit = log₂(3) ≈ 1.585 bits
14 fundamental dimensions + 7 emergent = 21 dimensional degrees of freedom
21 × 1.585 ≈ 33 bits
```

But crucially: **The tralsebit cannot be decomposed into 33 separate bits!**

It's holistic — like a snowflake pattern vs. individual water molecules.

## The Primordial Photon Connection

**NEW BREAKTHROUGH (Dec 2025):**

Double Tralse (dark energy) made the first photon by recognizing its own DT existence TRULY:

```
DT says: "I am both True and False"
This statement IS True.
Truth = dimension 9 collapse.
The first photon = DT's self-recognition across all 14 dimensions.
```

The most contradictory state recognized its own state **truly** — creating the first tralsebit with a definite True value in dimension 9.
