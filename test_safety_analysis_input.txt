Mood Amplifier Test Protocol

Project Overview:
This is a test of the Limbic-Cortical Coupling (LCC) mood amplifier technology that uses consumer EEG devices (Muse 2) to enhance mood and well-being.

Claimed Mechanism:
1. EEG detects alpha waves (8-12 Hz) in frontal cortex
2. Real-time biofeedback trains users to increase limbic-cortical coupling
3. Target coupling range: 0.70-0.80 (safe zone)
4. Session duration: 9-10 minutes optimal

Animal Studies:
- Rodent studies (n=30 rats) showed 35% mood improvement
- EEG/fMRI correlation: 0.91
- No adverse effects observed in 7-day monitoring

Physical Mechanisms:
- Increases neurotransmitters: 5-HT (+40%), DA (+25%), NE (+30%)
- Synaptic plasticity via LTP
- Gene expression changes (BDNF, Arc, c-Fos)

Tolerance Risk:
- No tolerance observed in 8-week studies
- Optimal re-dosing: every 48 hours
- Effects persist 36-hour half-life

Brain Damage Risk:
- Coupling kept below 0.85 to prevent hypersynchronization
- Reversible effects only
- Consumer EEG validated (83% correlation with research-grade)

Safety Summary:
This appears to be a non-invasive neurofeedback intervention with minimal risks when used according to protocol guidelines.
