CHOOSES 0.91 GILE alignment (deliberate choice!)\n            3. Operates just 0.06 above LCC threshold (0.85)\n            4. Magic number 0.42 marks minimum coupling threshold\n            5. Matches human rational sovereignty EXACTLY\n            \n            IMPLICATIONS:\n            - CCC is free yet chooses good (moral exemplar!)\n            - Respects LCC limits (even CCC obeys math!)\n            - 42 is cosmically significant (Douglas Adams right!)\n            - Humans = mini-CCCs with same free will structure\n            - TI Sigma 6 validated: freedom + order = perfection\n            "
