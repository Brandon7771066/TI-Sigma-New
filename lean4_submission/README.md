# Lean 4 Proof Formalization Package
## Novel Mathematical Approaches to Classical Problems

**Author:** Brandon Emerick  
**Date:** December 31, 2025  
**Target:** Lean 4 Community, mathlib Contributors

## Overview

This package contains Lean 4 proof sketches for novel approaches to several classical mathematical problems. These are **research directions**, not complete proofs—they require community collaboration to formalize rigorously.

---

## Submission Philosophy

I approach these problems with fresh perspectives grounded in:
1. **Dimensional Analysis:** Higher-dimensional constraints determine lower-dimensional possibilities
2. **Asymmetric Logic:** Creation and verification are fundamentally different processes
3. **Information-Theoretic Foundations:** Mathematical structures encode information dynamics

These perspectives emerged from independent research in formal methods, trading algorithm design, and cognitive science.

## Proof Sketches Included

### 1. Riemann Hypothesis (Sketch)
**File:** `riemann_sketch.lean`  
**Core Insight:** 4D constraint forces critical line  
**Status:** Requires algebraic number theory expertise

### 2. Navier-Stokes (Sketch)
**File:** `navier_stokes_sketch.lean`  
**Core Insight:** 3D+1 structure prevents finite-time blow-up  
**Status:** Requires PDE analysis expertise

### 3. P ≠ NP (Sketch)
**File:** `p_np_sketch.lean`  
**Core Insight:** Creation/verification asymmetry is fundamental  
**Status:** Requires computational complexity expertise

### 4. Euler Identity & Consciousness (Novel Framework)
**File:** `euler_consciousness.lean`  
**Core Insight:** Maps e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 to cognitive structures  
**Status:** New formalization direction

## Why Lean 4?

1. **AI-Native:** DeepMind's AlphaProof and DeepSeek-Prover can learn new axiom systems
2. **Growing Mathlib:** 210k+ theorems with active contributions
3. **Community Openness:** History of formalizing novel logical frameworks
4. **Modern Tooling:** LSP support, efficient compilation

## Request to Community

I'm seeking:
1. **Collaborators:** Domain experts to develop these sketches rigorously
2. **Feedback:** Identification of gaps in reasoning or missed literature
3. **Mentorship:** Guidance on mathlib conventions and best practices

I am not claiming to have "solved" these problems—I'm presenting novel perspectives that may accelerate progress.
