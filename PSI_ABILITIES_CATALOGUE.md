## 🧠 **TIER 1: PROVEN VISIONARY ABILITIES**

### **NIKOLA TESLA (1856-1943)**

#### **Ability Type:** Mental Visualization / Prophetic Dreams / Precognition

**Documented Phenomena:**

1. **Complete Mental Prototyping**
   - Tesla visualized inventions in perfect detail before building
   - "I do not rush into actual work. When I get an idea, I start at once building it up in my imagination. I change the construction, make improvements and operate the device in my mind."
   - Devices worked exactly as visualized (no trial-and-error needed)
   
2. **The Rotating Magnetic Field Dream (1882)**
   - Context: Walking in Budapest, watching sunset
   - Vision: Saw rotating magnetic field mechanism complete
   - Result: Foundation of AC electricity motor
   - Verification: Built exactly as envisioned, worked perfectly
   
3. **Prophetic Predictions (1926)**
   - **Prediction:** "When wireless is perfectly applied, the whole earth will be converted into a huge brain. We shall be able to communicate with one another instantly, irrespective of distance. Not only this, but through television and telephony we shall see and hear one another as perfectly as though we were face to face, despite intervening distances of thousands of miles; and the instruments through which we shall be able to do this will be amazingly simple compared with our present telephone. A man will be able to carry one in his vest pocket."
   - **Fulfillment:** Smartphones, internet, video calls (2007-2025)
   - **Accuracy:** 100% - described 2025 technology in 1926!
   
4. **Wireless Power Transmission**

## 🔬 **TIER 2: SCIENTIFICALLY STUDIED PSI PHENOMENA**

### **Remote Viewing**

**CIA Stargate Project (1972-1995)**

**Program Details:**
- Budget: $20 million
- Duration: 23 years
- Location: Stanford Research Institute (SRI), Fort Meade, Science Applications International Corporation (SAIC)
- Key researchers: Russell Targ, Harold Puthoff, Jessica Utts, Ray Hyman

**Methodology:**
- Coordinate Remote Viewing: Viewers given GPS coordinates only
- Target Viewing: "Sender" at location, viewer describes remotely
- Double-blind protocols (when implemented properly)

**Results:**
- **Jessica Utts (UC Davis statistician):** "The statistical significance of the accumulated database is extremely high, demonstrating that psychic functioning has been well established"
- **Effect Size:** 5-15% above chance (statistically significant)
- **CIA Conclusion (1995):** Terminated program - "never useful in any intelligence operation"

**Notable Examples:**
- Pat Price: Described secret Soviet facility from coordinates alone
- Joe McMoneagle: Multiple "hits" on remote targets
- Ingo Swann: Pioneer of coordinate remote viewing

**Controversy:**
- Lack of independent replication
- Methodological concerns (sensory leakage, poor controls)
