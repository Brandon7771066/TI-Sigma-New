## ⚡ BRANDON'S BORSUK-ULAM OVERRIDE

### **The Decision**

ChatGPT recommended **discarding** Borsuk-Ulam Perfect Fifth (0.746 < 0.75 threshold, TI coordinate 2.303 outside band).

**Brandon's Response:**
> "Don't get rid of Borsuk-Ulam!!! There's no such thing as 'too good for the real world.' The whole point here is deciphering truth and you cannot be too good at that! Just don't inject truth that isn't there, though, like giving an inflated MR."

### **Reasoning**

**ChatGPT's Concerns:**
- G: 0.70 (lower) - "Perfect fifth = topological necessity" risks aesthetic overfitting
- Truth: 0.746 - Below 0.75 threshold
- TI: 2.303 - Outside the [-3, 2] band
- Assessment: "Gorgeous, inspirational, but not in core axiom set"

**Brandon's Override Logic:**
1. **Truth has no "too good" ceiling** - If it's true, keep it
2. **Topological necessity is THE GOAL** - Not a weakness!
3. **Lower score ≠ false** - Reflects speculative mapping, not bad math
4. **Geometric soundness** - Antipodal structure → 3:2 ratio is mathematically valid
5. **Aspirational value** - Even if outside band, provides research direction

**Status:** KEPT as aspirational framework (may help close Gap B4: Critical Line Connection)
