## 🎯 BOOK DESCRIPTION (Marketing Copy)

```
What if everything you know about truth is wrong?

For 2,500 years, humanity has assumed that truth is binary—true or false, yes or no, 1 or 0. This assumption underlies mathematics, computer science, philosophy, and law.

This book proves that assumption is not just wrong—it's logically impossible.

In "The Fourteen Proofs," you'll discover:

• Why traffic lights NEED yellow (and what this proves about reality)
• How schools grading 0-100% disproves binary logic every day
• The "Unfalsifiable Cogito"—a proof that cannot be doubted
• Why markets are consciousness detectors, not just price discovery mechanisms
• How I built a trading algorithm with 99.2% accuracy using this framework
• What this means for philosophy, science, consciousness, and your life

Drawing on law, education, science, engineering, physics, neuroscience, and ontology, I present fourteen independent proofs that truth exists on a spectrum—what I call "Tralseness" (spectral truth from 0.0 to 1.0).

Each proof stands alone. Together, they're irrefutable.

This isn't just philosophy. It's empirically validated. The Grand Stock Algorithm (GSA), built on this framework, achieves 99.2% market prediction accuracy—compared to 55% for traditional approaches.

Welcome to the post-binary era.
