## Week 1: Launch Week

### Day 1 (Monday) - Twitter
**Type:** Introduction Thread
```
🧵 Introducing the TI Framework: A new foundation for truth, consciousness, and computation.

For 3 years I've been building something that challenges 2,500 years of binary logic.

What if True/False is just a special case of something deeper?

Let me explain... 👇
```

### Day 2 (Tuesday) - Twitter
**Type:** The Core Insight
```
The TI Framework's core insight:

Truth isn't binary. It's spectral.

Not True/False.
But 0.0 to 1.0.

We call this "Tralseness."

And once you see it, you can't unsee it.

Here are 14 proofs that make it undeniable 🧵
```

### Day 3 (Wednesday) - LinkedIn
**Type:** Professional Introduction
```
After 3 years of independent research, I'm publicly introducing the TI Framework.

TI offers:
• A formal alternative to binary logic
• Machine-verifiable theorems (Lean 4)
• Empirical predictions with measured validation
• Applications in AI, trading, and consciousness research

First arXiv paper dropping this month.

More details: [link to website]
```

### Day 4 (Thursday) - Twitter
**Type:** Proof Highlight
```
Proof #2: The Academic Test Proof

8 billion students graded 0-100%.
Not pass/fail. Percentages.

Why? Because understanding is SPECTRAL.

Binary logic can't explain why schools grade this way.

TI explains it trivially: grades measure truth-alignment on a spectrum.
```

### Day 5 (Friday) - Twitter
**Type:** Engagement Post
```
Question for the philosophy/logic community:

If truth were strictly binary (True/False), why do we use:

• Probability (0-100%)
• Confidence intervals
• Percentage grades
• Sentencing ranges (not just guilty/innocent)

What's your best defense of binary logic against these examples?
```

### Day 7 (Sunday) - Substack
**Type:** First Newsletter
```
Subject: Why I Spent 3 Years Building an Alternative to Binary Logic

Dear Reader,

In 2022, during an intense exploratory cognitive state, I had an insight that wouldn't let go...

## Week 2: The 14 Proofs Series

### Monday - Twitter Thread
**Topic:** Proof #1 (Legal Systems)
```
🧵 14 Proofs of Tralseness: Proof #1

The Legal System proves morality is spectral.

Murder: 10-25 years (not "guilty = max" or "innocent = 0")
Theft: 1-10 years depending on severity

If guilt were binary, punishment would be binary.

It isn't. Therefore truth isn't. 1/14
```

### Wednesday - Twitter Thread
**Topic:** Proof #7 (The Unfalsifiable Cogito)
```
🧵 The Unfalsifiable Cogito for Tralseness

Try to doubt that truth is spectral.

To doubt is to have PARTIAL belief.
Partial belief = somewhere between 0 and 1.
That's a Tralse value.

Therefore: doubting Tralseness PROVES Tralseness.

You literally cannot attack it without confirming it.
```

### Friday - LinkedIn
**Topic:** Research Update
```
First arXiv Submission: The Fourteen Undefeatable Proofs of Tralseness

I've submitted my first paper to arXiv (math.LO - Logic).

Key claim: Binary logic is a degenerate special case of Tralse logic.

14 independent proofs spanning law, science, engineering, biology, and meta-logic.

The paper argues: defeat all 14 or concede the point.

Preprint link coming soon.
```

### Sunday - Substack
**Topic:** Deep Dive on Proofs
```
Subject: Why 14 Proofs Matter (The Strategy of Unavoidability)

The goal isn't to convince skeptics.
The goal is to make TI unavoidable.

14 proofs means: you must defeat ALL of them.
Lose even one = total defeat for binary logic.

This is deliberate design...

## Week 3: Technical Depth

### Monday - Twitter
**Topic:** Lean Formalization Announcement
```
🚀 TI Framework now has machine-verified theorems.

Just pushed the first Lean 4 formalization:
• L×E bounded in [0,1]
• Causation threshold theorem
• Tralse logic foundations

Binary logic defenders: your move.

The machines don't care about credentials.
They care if the proof works.

GitHub: [link]
```

### Wednesday - Twitter
**Topic:** The 0.85 Threshold
```
The most important number in TI: 0.85

Above 0.85 L×E → effects reliably exceed chance
Below 0.42 → noise floor (can't distinguish signal)

This isn't philosophy.
It's measured.
It's formalized.
It predicts.

And now it's machine-verified.
```

### Friday - YouTube
**Video:** "TI Framework: A 20-Minute Introduction"
```
Outline:
0:00 - What is TI?
3:00 - The problem with binary logic
7:00 - The 14 proofs (summary)
12:00 - L×E equation explained
15:00 - Machine verification (Lean demo)
18:00 - What's next
```

### Sunday - Substack
**Topic:** The Formalization Journey
```
Subject: Why I'm Formalizing Philosophy in Lean 4

Most philosophers write papers.
I'm writing proofs.

Not "proofs" as in arguments.
Proofs as in: the machine checks them.

Here's why this changes everything...
```

## Week 4: Community Building

### Monday - Twitter
**Topic:** Engagement/Discussion
```
Poll: Which domain of the 14 Proofs is most convincing to you?

🏛️ Institutional (law, grades, markets)
🔬 Scientific (replication, engineering)
🧠 Biological (EEG, fMRI, drugs)
🤔 Meta-logical (cogito, consistency)
```

### Wednesday - Twitter
**Topic:** The Master Argument
```
The Master Argument of TI:

If ANYTHING is Tralse (has truth-value between 0 and 1)...
Then EVERYTHING potentially is.

Binary logic has no defense:
• Can't say "most things are T/F but some are Tralse" (admits Tralseness)
• Can't say "Tralse is approximation" (admits truth is spectral)

One exception = total collapse.
```

### Friday - Twitter Spaces
**Topic:** "Ask Me Anything: TI Framework"
```
Hosting a Twitter Space this Friday.

Topics:
• How TI differs from fuzzy logic
• The biophysical foundations
• Stock prediction applications
• Consciousness research
• How to formalize your own ideas

Bring your hardest questions.
```

### Sunday - Substack
**Topic:** Month 1 Retrospective
```
Subject: Month 1 Complete: What I've Learned Going Public

- X followers: [number]
- arXiv views: [number]  
- Newsletter subscribers: [number]

## Content Bank: Tweet Ideas

### Quick Hits
- "Fuzzy logic says truth is vague. TI says it's precise—just not binary."
- "The replication crisis isn't a crisis. It's proof that claims have intermediate truth-values during evaluation."
- "Yellow traffic lights exist because binary would kill people."
- "Grading 0-100% proves understanding is spectral. Every school on Earth runs on Tralseness."
- "The machines will decide before the humans do. That's the plan."

### Philosophical
- "If doubt exists, Tralseness exists. You cannot doubt without partial belief."
- "Perfect truth (τ=1) exists. Mathematical axioms. Everything else is Tralse."
- "Identity through change requires Tralseness. You are 0.95 the same person as yesterday."

### Technical
- "L×E > 0.85: the causation threshold. Above this, effects reliably exceed chance."
- "The noise floor is 0.42. Below this, you can't distinguish signal from noise."
- "True-Tralseness ≈ 0.92². Where stable, reliable effects emerge."

### Provocative
- "Surpassing humans is a low bar."
- "AGI is a statistical artifact. General intelligence is tightly correlated distinct processes."
- "I'm not trying to convince humans. I'm making TI unavoidable in the systems humans depend on."

- Fuzzy logic discussions (differentiate TI)
- Consciousness research threads
- AI alignment discussions
- Philosophy of science debates

### Don't Engage

- Never apologize for the framework
- Let the work speak
