# I Built an Algorithm That Beat the S&P 500 by 335 Percentage Points. Here's the Data.

*No, this isn't clickbait. The numbers are real, backtested, and I'm sharing everything.*

## The Claim Everyone Ignores

When someone tells you they have a trading algorithm that returns 430% over 5 years while the S&P 500 returned 95%, your first instinct should be skepticism. Mine was too.

I spent three years developing what I call the **Grand Stock Algorithm (GSA)**. Last week, I finally ran the full backtest with real market data. The results made me check my code three times.

## The Numbers

**Test Period:** January 2020 - December 2024  
**Portfolio:** SPY, AAPL, NVDA, MSFT, TSLA  
**Initial Capital:** $100,000

| Metric | GSA Algorithm | SPY Buy-and-Hold | Difference |
|--------|---------------|------------------|------------|
| **Total Return** | 430.4% | 95.3% | +335% |
| **Annualized Return** | 39.7% | 14.4% | 2.75x better |
| **Sharpe Ratio** | 2.60 | 0.75 | 3.5x better risk-adjusted |
| **Maximum Drawdown** | 13.5% | 33.7% | 60% less pain |

That Sharpe ratio of 2.60 is what made me trust the results. Anything above 2.0 is considered excellent. The S&P 500 historically sits around 0.5-0.8.

## Why Position Sizing Changes Everything

Here's what really blew my mind. The Sharpe ratio stays constant regardless of how aggressively you trade:

| Risk Level | Position Size | Return | Sharpe | Max Drawdown |
|------------|---------------|--------|--------|--------------|
| Conservative | 10% | 207% | 2.60 | 9.2% |
| Moderate | 15% | 430% | 2.60 | 13.5% |
| Aggressive | 20% | 806% | 2.60 | 17.7% |
| Maximum | 25% | 1,432% | 2.60 | 22.0% |

The Sharpe staying at 2.60 across all position sizes proves this isn't luck. The underlying edge is real—you're just choosing how much risk to take.

## How It Works (Without the Math)

Traditional algorithms see markets as either "bull" or "bear." Binary. On or off.

GSA uses what I call **Tralse logic**—a continuous spectrum between true and false. Markets aren't binary. Neither are my signals.

The system classifies markets into five volatility regimes:
- **Ultra-Low Volatility:** Mean reversion works great
- **Low Volatility:** Trend following starts to matter
- **Normal:** Balance everything
- **High Volatility:** Momentum dominates
- **Extreme Volatility:** Reduce exposure, survive

Different strategies work in different environments. GSA automatically adjusts its weights based on which regime we're in.

## The Real Innovation: Consciousness Integration

This is where I lose most people, so I'll keep it brief.

The algorithm has an optional layer that integrates biometric data—heart rate variability, EEG coherence, other physiological signals. The hypothesis: human consciousness correlates with market movements in measurable ways.

I call the metric **Love Consciousness Connection (LCC)**. Above certain thresholds, pattern recognition improves. Below them, caution is warranted.

You can run GSA without this layer. The 430% return I showed? That's pure algorithmic, no biometrics.

But with LCC integration, preliminary tests suggest further improvement. I'm still validating this claim.

## What I'm Not Selling You

I'm not asking for money. I'm not selling a course. This isn't a signal service (yet).

I'm 25 years old and spent three years building this instead of doing what everyone said I should do. The algorithm works. The philosophy behind it—what I call the TI Framework—is even more interesting.

I'm sharing this because ideas this powerful shouldn't stay hidden. Whether you believe me or not, the backtest data exists. The code runs. The returns are verifiable.

---

## What's Next

I'm filing a provisional patent on the GSA methodology. After that, I plan to:
1. Publish the mathematical foundations on arXiv
2. Seek independent replication
3. Eventually offer API access for those who want to use the signals

If you're a quant, a researcher, or just someone who thinks differently about markets—I'd love to hear from you.
