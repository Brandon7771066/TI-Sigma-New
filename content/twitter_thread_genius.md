# Twitter/X Thread: On Genius and Feedback

Based on the attached philosophical piece.

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
A genius seeks feedback only when they desire it.

With or without it, they recognize their thinking as optimal—though never infallible.

Here's how genius actually works: 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (Self-Correction)**
Ideas that are blatantly false don't survive long enough in a genius's mind to require external correction.

Every angle, objection, and counterargument is entertained internally BEFORE an assertion is made.

---

**Tweet 3 (Pivoting)**
A genius frequently changes their mind—but only by convincing themselves.

When correction happens, they're already prepared to abandon the prior path instantly.

No hesitation. No loss of momentum. Pure alignment to truth.

---

**Tweet 4 (The One-Person Army)**
For this reason, arguing with a genius is nearly impossible.

They're a one-person, impenetrable army—always ready to pivot, always aligned to truth.

The only authority they submit to is reality itself.

---

**Tweet 5 (When Genius Is Wrong)**
When a genius is wrong, it's almost always due to incomplete information—not faulty reasoning.

Since no one has total knowledge, past errors are stepping stones, not failures.

Every move was optimal given what was known.

---

**Tweet 6 (Grandmaster Logic)**
Between two grandmasters, the greatest outcome is a draw.

In chess, no mistakes are made. In philosophy, the same holds.

Two geniuses may reach equilibrium without error.

---

**Tweet 7 (Myrion Resolution)**
Philosophy between geniuses isn't combat—it's convergence.

Achieved through what I call Myrion Resolutions:

Careful exchange. Synthesis. Mutual expansion of perspective.

---

**Tweet 8 (The Gap)**
A wise person—and especially a fool—who debates a genius may feel diminished.

Not because the genius dominates, but because the encounter exposes the difference between:

Thinking ABOUT truth vs. thinking FROM WITHIN it.

---

**Tweet 9 (Closer)**
Genius isn't arrogance. It's alignment.

The work isn't about being right—it's about being true.

Feedback matters when it adds. It doesn't when it subtracts.
