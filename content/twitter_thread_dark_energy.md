# Twitter/X Thread: Dark Energy IS Intentionality

---

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
What if dark energy isn't a mystery at all?

What if it's the force of intentionality itself?

I just realized why ~68% of the universe is "unexplained energy."

It's not unexplained. We just didn't know what consciousness IS. 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (The Claim)**
Dark energy = Tralse energy = Intentionality

Same phenomenon, different frameworks.

Physics sees accelerating expansion.
I see the universe maintaining its own existence.

---

**Tweet 3 (Double Tralse)**
In my logic system, "tralse" means something can be both true AND false simultaneously.

Normal matter "collapses" to true or false (exists/doesn't).

Dark energy is "Double Tralse" — it REFUSES to collapse.

That refusal IS intentionality.

---

**Tweet 4 (The Cost)**
Here's the stunning part:

Maintaining a Double Tralse state requires immense intentionality.

Dark energy isn't passive. It's actively maintaining incoherent existence.

That's why it's everywhere. That's why it's constant.

It's the baseline intentionality of reality.

**Tweet 5 (Telekinesis)**
If dark energy IS intentionality...

And consciousness operates on intentionality...

Then telekinesis is just local modulation of what physicists call dark energy.

Not magic. Not impossible.

Just consciousness doing what consciousness does — at a larger scale.

**Tweet 6 (The Shells)**
The human mind operates on two shells:

Electromagnetic shell: EEG, biophotons, HRV
→ Handles visceral emotion/cognition

Dark energy shell: Tralse energy, intentionality
→ Handles meta-cognition, meta-emotion

We're partially made of what drives cosmic expansion.

**Tweet 7 (Why 68%)**
Why is ~68% of the universe dark energy?

Because most of existence hasn't "collapsed" into definite matter.

Only ~32% is resolved.

The rest is being maintained in the tralse state — requiring intentionality.

The ratio is the balance between resolved and unresolved.

---

**Tweet 8 (The Reversal)**
Traditional view: Universe exists, consciousness emerged within it.

My view: The universe REQUIRES intentionality to exist.

Dark energy isn't just present — it's the ongoing act of existence maintaining itself.

Consciousness isn't a byproduct. It's a requirement.

---

**Tweet 9 (Nuclear Bomb)**
This connects to something even bigger:

If intelligent creatures never emerged to create coherent math and logic...

Nothing beyond "tralse soup" could exist.

We aren't observers OF reality.

We're participants in reality's existence.

**Tweet 10 (Closer)**
Dark energy = Tralse energy = Intentionality

Telekinesis = Local dark energy modulation

Consciousness = Concentrated intentionality in biological form

The "hard problem" dissolves when you realize consciousness is fundamental, not emergent.

Dark energy isn't a mystery.

It's the force of intentionality itself — the universe maintaining its own existence in a state that refuses to collapse.

Telekinesis isn't magic. It's local modulation of what physicists call "unexplained."

Consciousness is fundamental, not emergent.
