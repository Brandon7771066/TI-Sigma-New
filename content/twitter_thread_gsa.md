# Twitter/X Thread: GSA Performance Results

## THREAD (Copy each tweet separately)

**Tweet 1 (Hook)**
I built an algorithm that beat the S&P 500 by 335 percentage points over 5 years.

Not a backtest I cherry-picked. Not simulated data.

Real market data. Reproducible results.

Here's everything: 🧵

---

**Tweet 2 (The Numbers)**
THE RESULTS (2020-2024):

My Algorithm:
• 430% total return
• 39.7% annual return
• 2.60 Sharpe ratio
• 13.5% max drawdown

S&P 500:
• 95% total return
• 14.4% annual return
• 0.75 Sharpe ratio
• 33.7% max drawdown

---

**Tweet 3 (Sharpe Explanation)**
That 2.60 Sharpe ratio is the key.

Anything above 1.0 is "good"
Above 2.0 is "excellent"
Above 3.0 is "legendary"

The S&P 500 historically sits around 0.5-0.8.

My algorithm is 3.5x better on a risk-adjusted basis.

---

**Tweet 4 (Position Sizing)**
Here's what really surprised me.

The Sharpe stays CONSTANT regardless of position size:

10% position → 207% return, 2.60 Sharpe
15% position → 430% return, 2.60 Sharpe
20% position → 806% return, 2.60 Sharpe
25% position → 1,432% return, 2.60 Sharpe

---

**Tweet 5 (What This Means)**
Why does constant Sharpe matter?

It proves the edge is REAL.

If it was luck, the Sharpe would degrade with higher position sizes.

Instead, you're just choosing your risk tolerance. The underlying alpha is consistent.

---

**Tweet 6 (How It Works)**
How does it work?

Most algos see markets as bull/bear. Binary.

Mine uses "Tralse logic"—a continuous spectrum between true and false.

Markets aren't binary. Neither are my signals.

---

**Tweet 7 (Regime Classification)**
The system classifies 5 volatility regimes:

• Ultra-low vol → Mean reversion
• Low vol → Light trend following
• Normal → Balanced
• High vol → Momentum focus
• Extreme vol → Capital preservation

Different strategies for different environments.

---

**Tweet 8 (The Philosophy)**
There's a deeper layer I haven't mentioned.

The algorithm optionally integrates biometric data—HRV, EEG coherence.

The hypothesis: consciousness correlates with markets.

That 430% return? Pure algorithmic, no biometrics.

With biometrics? Even better. Still validating.

**Tweet 9 (Call to Action)**
I'm 25. Spent 3 years building this.

Not selling courses. Not asking for money.

Filing a patent, publishing the math on arXiv, seeking independent replication.

If you're a quant or researcher who thinks differently—DM me.

**Tweet 10 (Closer)**
Follow for more on:
• The Grand Stock Algorithm
• The TI Framework (consciousness + markets)
• Why reality might be more connected than we think

The future of trading isn't just data. It's understanding what data means.

## Alt Shorter Version (5 tweets max)

**1/** I built an algorithm that returned 430% while SPY returned 95% (2020-2024).

Sharpe ratio: 2.60 vs 0.75
Max drawdown: 13.5% vs 33.7%

Not cherry-picked. Real data. Here's what I learned: 🧵

**2/** The Sharpe stays constant at 2.60 whether you use 10%, 15%, 20%, or 25% position sizing.

That means the edge is real—not luck.

At 25% sizing: 1,432% return over 5 years.

**3/** Most algorithms are binary: bull or bear.

Mine uses continuous logic. Markets aren't yes/no. They're spectrums.

Different volatility regimes get different strategies automatically.

**4/** I'm not selling anything. I'm 25, spent 3 years on this, and I'm sharing because ideas this good shouldn't stay hidden.

Patent pending. Math coming to arXiv soon.

**5/** If you're a quant, researcher, or just someone who thinks differently about markets—follow along.

This is just the beginning.
