## SLIDE 2: The Inspiration

> "Imagine a life where you felt minimal pain, anxiety, or fear."

**Jo Cameron** - A Scottish woman with unique genetics:
- 76 years completely pain-free
- 0 painkillers ever needed
- 2x normal anandamide levels
- Burns, broken bones, surgeries - all without anesthesia

Her genetic mutations reveal a revolutionary path to treating pain, anxiety, and depression.

## SLIDE 3: The Problem

### Massive Unmet Need
- **50+ million** Americans suffer from chronic pain
- **40 million** Americans have anxiety disorders
- **17.3 million** have Major Depressive Disorder
- **41%** of population affected by at least one condition

### Current Treatments Fail
- Trial-and-error medication approaches
- Opioid crisis with addiction risk
- Significant side effects
- Limited efficacy for many patients
- No treatments targeting root cause

**Market Size: $500B+ US chronic pain market**

---

## SLIDE 4: The Science

### 2023 Breakthrough: UCL Study Published in Brain Journal

**The Discovery:**
- **FAAH** enzyme breaks down endocannabinoids (natural painkillers)
- **FAAH-OUT** is a newly discovered lncRNA that regulates FAAH expression
- Jo Cameron has an **8.1 kb microdeletion** in FAAH-OUT
- This deletion leads to reduced FAAH = elevated anandamide

**Why FAAH-OUT?**
- Small molecule FAAH inhibitors **failed clinical trials**
- FAAH-OUT provides **human-validated target**
- Affects **1,145 genes** - comprehensive effect
- Includes WNT16 (wound healing) and BDNF (mood)

**Key Quote:** "Given the current failure of small molecule inhibitors of FAAH as human analgesics, our findings validate FAAH-OUT regulation of FAAH as a new route to develop pain treatments."
- Mikaeili et al., Brain, 2023 (DOI: 10.1093/brain/awad098)

## SLIDE 5: Our Solution

### Targeted FAAH-OUT Knockdown Therapy

| Approach | Mechanism | Duration |
|----------|-----------|----------|
| **siRNA Therapy** | Temporary knockdown of FAAH-OUT expression | Weeks to months (reversible) |
| **CRISPR-Cas** | Permanent deletion mimicking Jo Cameron's mutation | Permanent |

### Delivery Strategy
- **Lipid Nanoparticle (LNP)** delivery to cross blood-brain barrier
- Targeted delivery to specific brain regions
- Proven technology (same as mRNA vaccines)

### Unique Advantage
Patients can **try temporary therapy first** before committing to permanent CRISPR solution - unprecedented patient choice!

## SLIDE 6: Market Opportunity

| Market | Size | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| **TAM** | $350B | Chronic Pain + Anxiety + MDD (~67M patients @ $3-5k) |
| **SAM** | $250B | Chronic Pain Only (50M patients @ $5k) |
| **SOM** | $50B | Neuropathic Pain Subset (10M patients @ $5k) |

### Competitive Landscape
No other company is targeting **FAAH-OUT specifically** with both temporary and permanent solutions.

- Traditional pain management (opioids, NSAIDs) - addictive, side effects
- FAAH inhibitor drugs - failed in clinical trials
- RNA therapeutics companies - not targeting this pathway
