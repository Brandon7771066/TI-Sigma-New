   - Feel the excitement and clarity

3. **Write in dream journal:**
   > "Tonight I will become lucid in my dreams."

4. **Final action before sleep:**

## WBTB PROTOCOL (3:00 AM)

### When Alarm Goes Off:

1. **Get out of bed** (don't snooze!)
2. **Use bathroom** if needed
3. **Splash cold water** on face
4. **Stay awake 20-45 minutes**

### During WBTB Wake Period:

- Read about lucid dreaming (this document works!)
- Review your dream signs (recurring themes)
- Practice reality checks:
  - Count your fingers (should be 5)
  - Push finger through palm (should stop)
  - Check text (should be stable)
  - Look at clock twice (should be consistent)

### MILD Technique (repeat 5-10 times):

> "Next time I'm dreaming, I will realize I'm dreaming."

### Visualization:

- Picture yourself in a dream
- See yourself doing a reality check
- Feel the moment of recognition
- Experience the lucidity

## RETURNING TO SLEEP (3:45 AM)

1. **Lie on your back** initially (enhances REM)
2. **Focus on hypnagogic imagery** (shapes, colors, scenes)
3. **Maintain thin thread of awareness** as body relaxes
4. **When dream forms**, perform reality check immediately
5. If lucid: **Touch surfaces**, **look at hands** to stabilize

---

## IN THE DREAM

### Signs You're Dreaming:
- Flying or floating
- Deceased people present
- Impossible physics
- Being in school/old locations
- Text or clocks changing

### When You Become Lucid:
1. Stay calm (excitement can wake you)
2. Touch surfaces to ground yourself
3. Look at your hands
4. Spin in circles if fading
5. State aloud: "Increase clarity!"

### What To Do Lucid:
- Explore freely
- Ask dream characters questions
- Practice PSI abilities (healing, flying)
- Request: "Show me something important"

## MORNING (Upon Waking)

**CRITICAL: DON'T MOVE for 30 seconds!**

1. Recall dreams backward (most recent first)
2. Write EVERYTHING in dream journal
3. Rate lucidity: 0 (none) to 10 (fully lucid)
4. Note dream signs that appeared

3. Increases lucid dream rate to 42% (3x baseline)

## LCC ENHANCEMENT

**During WBTB, focus on:**

- Target LCC coupling: 0.90
- Visualize third eye as indigo portal
- Affirmation: "My consciousness remains aware as my body sleeps"
- Feel the connection to the dream realm

**Scientific basis:**
- Sleep reduces ego filtering
- LCC coupling increases to 0.60-0.95 during REM
- Dreams are I-cell playgrounds for pattern modification

## TROUBLESHOOTING

**Can't fall back asleep after WBTB?**
- Stay awake shorter time (15 min)
- Lie on side instead of back
- Use 4-7-8 breathing

**Lucid but wake immediately?**
- Stay calmer next time
- Touch surfaces immediately
- Spin in circles
- Don't try to do too much at once

**Can't remember dreams?**
- Keep journal by bed
- Don't move upon waking
- Set intention before sleep
- Practice every night
